title: ^1.0.0 to ^2.0.0
---

Riverpod went `2.0`! To see the full list of changes, consult the [Changelog].

In this page, we will focus on:
- How to migrate from the deprecated `StateNotifier` to the new `Notifier`
- How to handle the new `AsyncValue` behavior and its new properties
- How to migrate from `ProviderListener` to `ProviderObserver` for logging purposes


## From `StateNotifier`(or `ChangeNotifier`) to `Notifier` (or `AsyncNotifier`)

Riverpod `2.0` introduced the new `Notifier` and `AsyncNotifier` classes.  
These two are meant to replace the - now - legacy `StateNotifier`, with the following advantages:
- Codegen support
- One less [external dependency]
- Easier distinction between sync and async providers
- Easier provider initialization

Alas, these features introduce a few breaking changes. This page is meant to help you overcome these.
