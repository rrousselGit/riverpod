Within Riverpod, `ChangeNotifierProvider` is meant to be used to offer a smooth transition from
pkg:provider.

If you've just started a migration to pkg:riverpod, make sure you read the dedicated guide
(see <Link documentID="from_provider/quickstart" />).
This article is meant for folks that already transitioned to riverpod, but want to move away from
`ChangeNotifier` definetively.

All in all, migrating from `ChangeNotifier` to `AsyncNotifer` requires a
paradigm shift, but it brings great simplification with the resulting migrated
code. See also <Link documentID="concepts/why_immutability" />.

Take this (faulty) example:
<AutoSnippet raw={old} />

This implementation shows several weak design choices such as:
- The usage of `isLoading` and `hasError` to handle different asynchronous cases
- The need to carefully handle requests with tedious `try`/`catch`/`finally` expressions
- The need to inkove `notifyListeners` at the right times to make this implementation work
- The presence of inconsistent or possibly undesirable states, e.g. initialization with an empty list

Note how this example has been crafted to show how `ChangeNotifier` can lead to faulty design choices
for newbie developers; also, another takeaway is that mutable state might be way harder than it
initially promises.

`Notifier`/`AsyncNotifer`, in combination with immutable state, can lead to better design choices
and less errors.

Let's see how to migrate the above snippet, one step at a time, towards the newest APIs.


## Start your migration
First, we should declare the new provider / notifier: this requires some thought process which
depends on your unique business logic.

Let's summarize the above requirements:
- State is represented with `List<Todo>`, which obtained via a network call, with no parameters
- State should *also* expose info about its `loading`, `error` and `data` state
- State can be mutated via some exposed methods, thus a function isn't enough

:::tip
The above thought process boils down to answering the following questions:
1. Are some side effects required?
    - `y`: Use riverpod's class-based API
    - `n`: Use riverpod's function-based API
2. Does state need to be loaded asynchronously?
    - `y`: Let `build` return a `Future<T>`
    - `n`: Let `build` simply return `T`
3. Are some parameters required?
    - `y`: Let `build` (or your function) accept them
    - `n`: Let `build` (or your function) accept no extra parameters
:::

:::info
If you're using codegen, the above thought process is enough.  
There's no need to think about the right class names and their *specific* APIs.  
`@riverpod` only asks you to write a class with its return type, and you're good to go.
:::

Technically, the best fit here is to define a `AutoDisposeAsyncNotifier<List<Todo>>`,
which meets all the above requirements. Let's write some pseudocode first.

<AutoSnippet language="dart" {...declaration}></AutoSnippet>

:::tip
Remember: use snippets in your IDE to get some guidance, or just to speed up your code writing.
See <Link documentID="introduction/getting_started" hash="going-further-installing-code-snippets" />.
:::

With respect with `ChangeNotifier`'s implementation, we don't need to declare `todos` anymore;
such variable is `state`, which is implicitly loaded with `build`.

Indeed, riverpod's notifiers can expose *one* entity at a time.

:::tip
Riverpod's API is meant to be granular; nonetheless, when migrating, you can still define a custom
entity to hold multiple values. Consider using [Dart 3's records](https://dart.dev/language/records)
to smooth out the migration at first.

### Initialization
Initalizing a notifier is easy: just write initialization logic inside `build`.  
We can now get rid of the old `_init` function.

<AutoSnippet language="dart" {...initialization}></AutoSnippet>

With respect of the old `_init`, the new `build` isn't missing anything: there is no need to
initialize variables such as `isLoading` or `hasError` anymore.

Riverpod will automatically translate any asynchronous provider, via exposing an `AsyncValue<List<Todo>>`
and handles the intricacies of asynchronous state way better than what two simple boolean flags can do.

Indeed, any `AsyncNotifier` effectively makes writing additional `try`/`catch`/`finally` an anti-pattern
for handling asynchronous state.


### Mutations and Side Effects
Just like initialization, when performing side effects there's no need to manipulate boolean flags
such as `hasError`, or to write additional `try`/`catch`/`finally` blocks.

Below, we've cut down all the boilerplate and successfully fully migrated the above example:
<AutoSnippet language="dart" {...migrated} />

:::tip
Syntax and design choices may vary, but in the end we just need to write our request and update
state afterwards. See <Link documentID="essentials/side_effects" />.

## Migration Process Summary

Let's review the whole migration process applied above, from a operational point of view.

1. We've moved the initialization, away from a custom method invoked in a constructor, to `build`
2. We've removed `todos`, `isLoading` and `hasError` properties: internal `state` will suffice
3. We've removed any `try`-`catch`-`finally` blocks: returning the future is enough
4. We've applied the same simplification on the side effects (`addTodo`)
5. We've applied the mutations, via simply reassign `state`
