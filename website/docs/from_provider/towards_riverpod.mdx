title: Towards Riverpod
---


Originally, a major version of Provider was planned to ship, as a way to solve 
the aforementioned problems.  
But it was then decided against it, as this would have been 
"too breaking" and even controversial, because of the new `ConsumerWidget` API.  
Since Provider is still one of the most used Flutter packages, it was instead decided 
to create a separate package, and thus Riverpod was created.

Creating a separate package enabled:
  - Ease of migration for whoever wants to, by also enabling the temporary use of both approaches, *at the same time*;
  - Allow folks to stick to Provider if they dislike Riverpod in principle, or if they didn't find it reliable yet;
  - Experimentation, allowing for Riverpod to search for production-ready solutions to the various Provider's technical limitations.

Indeed, Riverpod is designed to be the spiritual successor of Provider. Hence the name "Riverpod" (which is an anagram of "Provider").

## The relationship between Riverpod and Provider
Still, conceptually, Riverpod and Provider are fairly similar.
Both packages fill a similar role. Both try to:

- cache and dispose some stateful objects;
- offer a way to mock those objects during tests;
- offer a way for Widgets to listen to those objects in a simple way.

You can think of Riverpod as what Provider could've been if it continued to mature for a few years.

## The breaking change
The only true downside of Riverpod is that it requires changing the widget type to work:

- Instead of extending `StatelessWidget`, with Riverpod you should extend `ConsumerWidget`.
- Instead of extending `StatefulWidget`, with Riverpod you should extend `ConsumerStatefulWidget`.

But this inconvenience is fairly minor in the grand scheme of things. And this requirement might, one day, disappear.

## Choosing the right library
You're probably asking yourself: 
*"So, as a Provider user, should I use Provider or Riverpod?"*.

We want to answer to this question very clearly:

    You probably should be using Riverpod

Riverpod is overhaul better designed and could lead to drastic simplifications of your logic.
