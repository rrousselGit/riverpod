title: Migrating tips
---


Migrating from Provider to Riverpod can be very straightforward.  
Migrating basically consists in a few steps that can be done in an *incremental* way.

## A gentle start
*If you have an existing app, don't try to migrate all your providers at once.*  
Don't immediately try to change your `ChangeNotifiers` into the more modern [AsyncNotifiers] from Riverpod.

This will requite a bit of a paradigm shift, so it may be difficult to do initially.  
Take your time, as it is important to get yourself familiar with Riverpod first.

It's fine to keep using `ChangeNotifier` using Riverpod and not use the latest fancy Riverpod features ASAP.

While you should strive toward moving all your application to Riverpod in the long-run, 
**don't burn yourself out**.  
Do it one provider at a time.

## Riverpod and Provider can coexist
*Keep in mind that it is entirely possible to use both Provider and Riverpod at the same time.*

Indeed, using import aliases, it is possible to use the two APIs altogheter.  
This is also great for readibilty and it removes any ambiguous API usage.

If you plan on doing this, consider using import aliases for each Provider import in your codebase.

## Migrating one Provider at a time
*All Providers from pkg:provider have a strict equivalent in Riverpod*.

In particular, you'll find [ChangeNotifierProvider], which is there to enable migration from Provider.  
This provider is not recommended when writing new code, and it is not the best way to use Riverpod, but 
it's a gentle and very easy way to start your migration.

Thus, migrating consists in moving a `provider.Provider` definition *outside* of `MultiProvider`, 
and change it to a `riverpod.Provider` definition (see the differences below).


## Code Generation
[Code generation] is recommended to use Riverpod the *cutting edge* way.  
Even so, don't try using codegen right away.

Instead, this should be taken as a further step forward.

Once the "base" migration is done, and you're positive that there are no more `ChangeNotifierProvider`s 
in your codebase, you can start migrating towards the codegen apprach, which has a simpler yet different syntax.
