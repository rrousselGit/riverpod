## Try Riverpod online

Before anything, we'd suggest you try out Riverpod in a sandbox to test its features out.

The following example should be familiar and readable enough:
  - dartpad.dev example (link)
  - marvel app example, or another github repo example (link)
  - ... more?

## Migrating

This section is designed for people familiar with the [Provider] package who
wants to learn about Riverpod.

Migrating from Provider to Riverpod can be very straightforward.  
Migrating basically consists in a few steps that can be done in an *incremental* way.

### Start with `ChangeNotifierProvider`
*If you have an existing app, don't try to migrate all your providers at once.*  
Don't immediately try to change your `ChangeNotifiers` into the more modern [AsyncNotifiers] from Riverpod.
This will requite a bit of a paradigm shift, so it may be difficult to do initially.  

Take your time, as it is important to get yourself familiar with Riverpod first.  
The following is perfectly fine to start with:

```dart
// If you have this...
class MyNotifier extends ChangeNotifier {
  int state = 0;

  void increment() {
    state++;
    notifyListeners();
  }
}

// ... just add this!
final myNotifierProvider = ChangeNotifierProvider<MyNotifier>((ref) {
  return MyNotifier();
});
```

It's fine to keep using `ChangeNotifier` using Riverpod and not use the latest fancy Riverpod features ASAP.

While you should strive toward moving all your application to Riverpod in the long-run, 
**don't burn yourself out**.  
Do it one provider at a time.  

### Riverpod and Provider can coexist
*Keep in mind that it is entirely possible to use both Provider and Riverpod at the same time.*

Indeed, using import aliases, it is possible to use the two APIs altogheter.  
This is also great for readibilty and it removes any ambiguous API usage.

If you plan on doing this, consider using import aliases for each Provider import in your codebase.

### Migrate one Provider at a time
*Almost* all Providers from pkg:provider have a strict equivalent in pkg:riverpod.

In particular, you'll find [ChangeNotifierProvider], which is there to enable migration from Provider.  
This provider is not recommended when writing new code, and it is not the best way to use Riverpod, but 
it's a gentle and very easy way to start your migration.

Take the above example. Fully migrating that Provider means writing the following:

```dart
class MyNotifier extends Notifier<int> {
  @override
  int build() => 0;

  void increment() => state++;
}

final myNotifierProvider = NotifierProvider<MyNotifier, int>(MyNotifier.new);
```

Thus, migrating consists in moving `provider.Provider` definitions *outside* of `MultiProvider`, 
defining it as a final global `riverpod.Provider` variable and using `riverpod`'s new classes where needed.

### Migrating a `ProxyProvider`
Within pkg:Provider, `ProxyProvider` is used to combine values from other Providers;
its build depends on the value of other providers, reactively.

With Riverpod, instead, Providers [are composable by default]; therefore, when migrating a `ProxyProvider`
you'll simply need to write `ref.watch` if you want a direct dependency from a Provider to another, or `ref.listen`
if your Proxy used to simply trigger a side-effect.

If anything, combining values with Riverpod should feel simpler and straightforward; thus, the migration should greatly
simplify your code.

Furthermore, there are no shanenigans about combining more than two providers together:
just add another `ref.watch` (or `ref.listen`) and you'll be good to go.


### Code Generation
[Code generation] is recommended to use Riverpod the *cutting edge* way.  
Even so, don't try using codegen right away.

Instead, this should be taken as a further step forward.

Once the "base" migration is done, and you're positive that there are no more `ChangeNotifierProvider`s 
in your codebase, you can start migrating towards the codegen apprach, which has a simpler yet different syntax.

With codegen, the above example becomes: 

```dart
@riverpod
class MyNotifier extends _$MyNotifier {
  @override
  int build() => 0;

  void increment() => state++;
}
```
