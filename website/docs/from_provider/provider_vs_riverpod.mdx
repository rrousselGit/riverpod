This article recaps the differences and the similarities between Provider and Riverpod.

## Defining providers

The primary difference between both packages is how "providers" are defined.

With [Provider], providers are widgets and as such placed inside the widget tree,
typically inside a `MultiProvider`:

```dart
class Counter extends ChangeNotifier {
 ...
}

void main() {
  runApp(
    MultiProvider(
      providers: [
        ChangeNotifierProvider<Counter>(create: (context) => Counter()),
      ],
      child: MyApp(),
    )
  );
}
```

With Riverpod, providers are **not** widgets. Instead they are plain Dart objects.  
Similarly, providers are defined outside of the widget tree, and instead are declared
as global final variables.

Also, for Riverpod to work, it is necessary to add a `ProviderScope` widget above the
entire application. As such, the equivalent of the Provider example using Riverpod
would be:

```dart
// Providers are now top-level variables
final counterProvider = ChangeNotifierProvider<Counter>((ref) => Counter());

void main() {
  runApp(
    // This widget enables Riverpod for the entire project
    ProviderScope(
      child: MyApp(),
    ),
  );
}
```

Notice how the provider definition simply moved up a few lines.

Since with Riverpod providers are plain Dart objects, it is possible to use
Riverpod without Flutter.  
For example, Riverpod can be used to write command line applications.

## Reading providers: BuildContext

With Provider, one way of reading providers is to use a Widget's `BuildContext`.

For example, if a provider was defined as:

```dart
Provider<Model>(...);
```

then reading it using [Provider] is done with:

```dart
class Example extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    Model model = context.watch<Model>();

  }
}
```

The equivalent in Riverpod would be:

```dart
final modelProvider = Provider<Model>(...);

class Example extends ConsumerWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
    Model model = ref.watch(modelProvider);

  }
}
```

Notice how:

- Riverpod's snippet extends `ConsumerWidget` instead of `StatelessWidget`.
  That different widget type adds one extra parameter to our `build` function:
  `WidgetRef`.

- Instead of `BuildContext.watch`, in Riverpod we do `WidgetRef.watch`, using
  the `WidgetRef` which we obtained from `ConsumerWidget`.

- Riverpod does not rely on generic types. Instead it relies on the variable
  created using provider definition.

Notice too how similar the wording is. Both Provider and Riverpod use the keyword
"watch" to describe "this widget should rebuild when the value changes".

:::info
Riverpod uses the same terminology as Provider for reading providers.

- `BuildContext.watch` -> `WidgetRef.watch`
- `BuildContext.read` -> `WidgetRef.read`
- `BuildContext.select` -> `WidgetRef.watch(myProvider.select)`

The rules for `context.watch` vs `context.read` applies to Riverpod too:  
Inside the `build` method, use "watch". Inside click handlers and other events,
use "read". When in need of filtering out values and rebuilds, use "select".
:::

## Reading providers: Consumer

Provider optionally comes with a widget named `Consumer` (and variants such as `Consumer2`)
for reading providers.

`Consumer` is helpful as a performance optimization, by allowing more granular rebuilds
of the widget tree - updating only the relevant widgets when the state changes:

As such, if a provider was defined as:

```dart
Provider<Model>(...);
```

Provider allows reading that provider using `Consumer` with:

```dart
Consumer<Model>(
  builder: (BuildContext context, Model model, Widget? child) {

  }
)
```

Riverpod has the same principle. Riverpod, too, has a widget named `Consumer`
for the exact same purpose.

If we defined a provider as:

```dart
final modelProvider = Provider<Model>(...);
```

Then using `Consumer` we could do:

```dart
Consumer(
  builder: (BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref, Widget? child) {
    Model model = ref.watch(modelProvider);

  }
)
```

Notice how `Consumer` gives us a `WidgetRef` object. This is the same object
as we saw in the previous part related to `ConsumerWidget`.

### There is no `ConsumerN` equivalent in Riverpod

Notice how pkg:Provider's `Consumer2`, `Consumer3` and such aren't needed nor missed in Riverpod.

With Riverpod, if you want to read values from multiple providers, you can simply write multiple `ref.watch` statements,
like so:

```dart
Consumer(
  builder: (context, ref, child) {
    Model1 model = ref.watch(model1Provider);
    Model2 model = ref.watch(model2Provider);
    Model3 model = ref.watch(model3Provider);
    // ...
  }
)
```

When compared to pkg:Provider's `ConsumerN` APIs, the above solution feels way less heavy and it should be easier to understand.

## Combining providers: ProxyProvider with stateless objects

When using Provider, the official way of combining providers is using the
`ProxyProvider` widget (or variants such as `ProxyProvider2`).

For example we may define:

```dart
class UserIdNotifier extends ChangeNotifier {
  String? userId;
}

// ...

ChangeNotifierProvider<UserIdNotifier>(create: (context) => UserIdNotifier()),
```

From there we have two options. We may combine `UserIdNotifier` to create a new
"stateless" provider (typically an immutable value that possibly override ==).
Such as:

```dart
ProxyProvider<UserIdNotifier, String>(
  update: (context, userIdNotifier, _) {
    return 'The user ID of the the user is ${userIdNotifier.userId}';
  }
)
```

This provider would automatically return a new `String` whenever
`UserIdNotifier.userId` changes.

We can do something similar in Riverpod, but the syntax is different.  
First, in Riverpod, the definition of our `UserIdNotifier` would be:

```dart
class UserIdNotifier extends ChangeNotifier {
  String? userId;
}

// ...

final userIdNotifierProvider = ChangeNotifierProvider<UserIdNotifier>(
  (ref) => UserIdNotifier(),
);
```

From there, to generate our `String` based on the `userId`, we could do:

```dart
final labelProvider = Provider<String>((ref) {
  UserIdNotifier userIdNotifier = ref.watch(userIdNotifierProvider);
  return 'The user ID of the the user is ${userIdNotifier.userId}';
});
```

Notice the line doing `ref.watch(userIdNotifierProvider)`.

This line of code tells Riverpod to obtain the content of the `userIdNotifierProvider`
and that whenever that value changes, `labelProvider` will be recomputed too.
As such, the `String` emitted by our `labelProvider` will automatically update
whenever the `userId` changes.

This `ref.watch` line should feel similar. This pattern was covered previously
when explaining [how to read providers inside widgets](#reading-providers-buildcontext).
Indeed, providers are now able to listen to other providers in the same way
that widgets do.

## Combining providers: ProxyProvider with stateful objects

When combining providers, another alternative use-case is to expose
stateful objects, such as a `ChangeNotifier` instance.

For that, we could use `ChangeNotifierProxyProvider` (or variants such as `ChangeNotifierProxyProvider2`).  
For example we may define:

```dart
class UserIdNotifier extends ChangeNotifier {
  String? userId;
}

// ...

ChangeNotifierProvider<UserIdNotifier>(create: (context) => UserIdNotifier()),
```

Then, we can define a new `ChangeNotifier` that is based on `UserIdNotifier.userId`.
For example we could do:

```dart
class UserNotifier extends ChangeNotifier {
  String? _userId;

  void setUserId(String? userId) {
    if (userId != _userId) {
      print('The user ID changed from $_userId to $userId');
      _userId = userId;
    }
  }
}

// ...

ChangeNotifierProxyProvider<UserIdNotifier, UserNotifier>(
  create: (context) => UserNotifier(),
  update: (context, userIdNotifier, userNotifier) {
    return userNotifier!
      ..setUserId(userIdNotifier.userId);
  },
);
```

This new provider creates a single instance of `UserNotifier` (which is never re-constructed)
and prints a string whenever the user ID changes.

Doing the same thing in provider is achieved differently.
First, in Riverpod, the definition of our `UserIdNotifier` would be:

```dart
class UserIdNotifier extends ChangeNotifier {
  String? userId;
}

// ...

final userIdNotifierProvider = ChangeNotifierProvider<UserIdNotifier>(
  (ref) => UserIdNotifier(),
),
```

From there, the equivalent to the previous `ChangeNotifierProxyProvider` would be:

```dart
class UserNotifier extends ChangeNotifier {
  String? _userId;

  void setUserId(String? userId) {
    if (userId != _userId) {
      print('The user ID changed from $_userId to $userId');
      _userId = userId;
    }
  }
}

// ...

final userNotifierProvider = ChangeNotifierProvider<UserNotifier>((ref) {
  final userNotifier = UserNotifier();
  ref.listen<UserIdNotifier>(
    userIdNotifierProvider,
    (previous, next) {
      if (previous?.userId != next.userId) {
        userNotifier.setUserId(next.userId);
      }
    },
  );

  return userNotifier;
});
```

The core of this snippet is the `ref.listen` line.  
This `ref.listen` function is a utility that allows listening to a provider,
and whenever the provider changes, executes a function.

The `previous` and `next` parameters of that function correspond to the
last value before the provider changed and the new value after it changed.

## Scoping Providers vs `.family` + `.autoDispose`
In pkg:Provider, scoping was used for two things:
  - destroying state when leaving a page
  - having custom state per page

Using scoping just to destroy state isn't ideal.  
The problem is that scoping doesn't work well over large applications.  
For example, state often is created in one page, but destroyed later in a different page after navigation.  
This doesn't allow for multiple caches to be active over different pages.

Similarly, the "custom state per page" approach quickly becomes difficult to handle if that state 
needs to be shared with another part of the widget tree, 
like you'd need with modals or a with a multi-step form.

Riverpod takes a different approach: first, scoping providers is kind-of discouraged; second, 
`.family` and `.autoDispose` are a complete replacement solution for this.

Within Riverpod, Providers marked as `.autoDispose` automatically destroy their state when they aren't used anymore.  
When the last widget removing a provider is unmounted, Riverpod will detect this and destroy the provider.  
Try using these two lifecycle methods in a provider to test this behavior:

```dart
ref.onCancel((){
  print("No one listens to me anymore!");
});
ref.onDispose((){
  print("If I've been defined as `.autoDispose`, I just got disposed!");
});
```

This inherently solves the "destroying state" problem.

Also it is possible to mark a Provider as `.family` (and, at the same time, as `.autoDispose`).  
This enables passing parameters to providers, which make multiple providers to be spawned and tracked internally.  
In other words, when passing parameters, *a unique state is created per unique parameter*.

<AutoSnippet language="dart" {...family}></AutoSnippet>


This solves the "custom state per page" problem. Actually, there's another advantage: such state is no-longer bound to one specific page.  
Instead, if a different page tries to access the same state, such page will be able to do so by just reusing the parameters.
 
In many ways, passing parameters to providers is equivalent to a Map key.  
If the key is the same, the value obtained is the same. If it's a different key, a different state will be obtained.
