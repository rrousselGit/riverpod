`StreamProvider` is similar to [FutureProvider] but for [Stream]s instead of
[Future]s.

`StreamProvider` is usually used for:

- listening to Firebase or web-sockets
- rebuilding another provider every few seconds

Since [Stream]s naturally expose a way for listening to updates, some may think
that using `StreamProvider` has a low value. In particular, you may believe that
Flutter's [StreamBuilder] would work just as well for listening to a [Stream], but
this is a mistake.

Using `StreamProvider` over [StreamBuilder] has numerous benefits:

- it allows other providers to listen to the stream using [ref.watch].
- it ensures that loading and error cases are properly handled, thanks to [AsyncValue].
- it removes the need for having to differentiate broadcast streams vs normal streams.
- it caches the latest value emitted by the stream, ensuring that if a
  listener is added after an event is emitted, the listener will still have
  immediate access to the most up-to-date event.
- it allows easily mocking the stream during tests by overriding the `StreamProvider`.

## Usage example: live chat using sockets

`StreamProvider` is used in when we handle stream of asynchronous data
such as Video Streaming, Weather broadcasting Apis or Live chat as follows:

<AutoSnippet language="dart" {...streamProvider}></AutoSnippet>

Then, the UI can listen to live streaming chats like so:

<CodeBlock>{trimSnippet(streamConsumer)}</CodeBlock>
