`StateNotifierProvider` is a provider that is used to listen to expose a
[StateNotifier] (from the package [state_notifier], which Riverpod re-exports).  
`StateNotifierProvider` along with [StateNotifier] is Riverpod's recommended solution
for managing state which may change in reaction to a user interaction.

It is typically used for:

- exposing an **immutable** state which can change over time after reacting to
  custom events.
- centralizing the logic for modifying some state (aka "business logic") in a
  single place, improving maintainability over time.


As a usage example, we could use `StateNotifierProvider` to implement a todo-list.
Doing so would allow us to expose methods such as `addTodo` to let the UI
modify the list of todos on user interactions:

<CodeBlock>{trimSnippet(todos)}</CodeBlock>

Now that we have defined a `StateNotifierProvider`, we can now use it to interact
with the list of todos in our UI:

<CodeBlock>{trimSnippet(todosConsumer)}</CodeBlock>
