In Riverpod, _all_ providers can be overridden to change their behavior.
This is useful for testing, debugging, or providing different implementations in different environments,
or even <Link documentID="concepts2/scoping"/>.

Overriding a provider is done on <Link documentID="concepts2/containers"/>, using the `overrides` parameter.
In it, you can specify a list of instructions on how to override a specific provider.

Such "instruction" is created using your provider, combined with value methods named `overrideWithSomething`.  
There are a bunch of these methods available, but all of them have their name starting with `overrideWith`.
This includes:
- [overrideWith](https://pub.dev/documentation/hooks_riverpod/3.0.0-dev.18/hooks_riverpod/Provider/overrideWith.html)
- [overrideWithValue](https://pub.dev/documentation/hooks_riverpod/3.0.0-dev.18/hooks_riverpod/FutureProvider/overrideWithValue.html)
- [overrideWithBuild](https://pub.dev/documentation/hooks_riverpod/3.0.0-dev.18/hooks_riverpod/StreamProvider/overrideWithBuild.html)

A typical override looks like this:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="scope" label="ProviderScope">

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(
    ProviderScope(
      overrides: [
        // Your overrides are defined here.
        // The following shows how to override a "counter provider"
        // to use a different initial value.
        counterProvider.overrideWith((ref) => 42),
      ]
    )
  );
}
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="container" label="ProviderContainer">

```dart
final container = ProviderContainer(
  overrides: [
    // Your overrides are defined here.
    // The following shows how to override a "counter provider"
    // to use a different initial value.
    counterProvider.overrideWith((ref) => 42),
  ]
);
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
