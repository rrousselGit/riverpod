title: Scoping providers
---

Scoping is the act of changing the behavior of a provider for only a small part of your application.

This is useful for:
- Page-specific customization (e.g changing the theme of your app for one specific page)
- Performance optimization (e.g rebuilding only the item that changes in a `ListView`)

Scoping is achieved using <Link documentID="concepts2/overrides" />, by 
overriding a provider in <Link documentID="concepts2/containers" /> that are _not_ the root of your application.

:::caution
Scoping is a fairly advanced feature, and there are often 
simpler alternatives to achieve the same result.

There are some better solutions being developed to simplify scoping.
But as of now, use scoping as a last resort.
