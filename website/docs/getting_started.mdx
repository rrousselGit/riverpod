Before diving into the inner mechanisms of [Riverpod], let's start with the basics:
Installing [Riverpod], then writing a "Hello world".

## What package to install

Before anything, you need to be aware that [Riverpod] is spread across multiple packages, with slightly different usage.  
The variant of [Riverpod] that you will want to install depends on the app you are making.

You can refer to the following table to help you decide which package to use:

| app type                  | package name                                                                      | description                                                                   |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Flutter only              | [flutter_riverpod]                                                                | A basic way of using [Riverpod] with flutter.                                 |
| Flutter + [flutter_hooks] | [hooks_riverpod]                                                                  | A way to use both [flutter_hooks] and [Riverpod] together.                    |
| Dart only (No Flutter)    | [riverpod](https://github.com/rrousselGit/riverpod/tree/master/packages/riverpod) | A version of [Riverpod] with all the classes related to Flutter stripped out. |

## Installing the package

Once you know what package you want to install, proceed to add the following to your `pubspec.yaml`:

<Tabs
  groupId="riverpod"
  defaultValue="flutter_riverpod"
  values={[
    { label: 'Flutter', value: 'flutter_riverpod', },
    { label: 'Dart only', value: 'riverpod', },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="flutter_riverpod">

<AutoSnippet title="pubspec.yaml" language="yaml" {...pubspec}></AutoSnippet>

Then install packages with `flutter pub get`.

<ConditionalSnippet codegen={true}>
  Finally, run the code-generator with{" "}
  <code>flutter pub run build_runner watch</code>
</ConditionalSnippet>

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="riverpod">

<AutoSnippet
  title="pubspec.yaml"
  language="yaml"
  {...dartPubspec}
></AutoSnippet>

Then install packages with `dart pub get`.

<ConditionalSnippet codegen={true}>
  Finally, run the code-generator with{" "}
  <code>flutter pub run build_runner watch</code>
</ConditionalSnippet>

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

That's it. You've added [Riverpod] to your app!

## Usage example: Hello world

Now that we have installed [Riverpod], we can start using it.

The following snippets showcase how to use our new dependency to make a "Hello world":

export const foo = 42;

<Tabs
  groupId="riverpod"
  defaultValue="flutter_riverpod"
  values={[
    { label: "Flutter", value: "flutter_riverpod" },
    { label: "Dart only", value: "riverpod" },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="flutter_riverpod">

<AutoSnippet
  title="lib/main.dart"
  language="dart"
  {...helloWorld}
></AutoSnippet>

Which you can then execute with `flutter run`.  
This will render "Hello world" on your device.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="riverpod">

<AutoSnippet
  title="lib/main.dart"
  language="dart"
  {...dartHelloWorld}
></AutoSnippet>

Which you can then execute with `dart lib/main.dart`.  
This will print "Hello world" in the console.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
