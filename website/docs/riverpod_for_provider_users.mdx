This article is designed for people familiar with the [Provider] package who
wants to learn about Riverpod.

But why was Riverpod created in the first place?

## Provider's limitations
Provider has fundamental issues due to being restricted by the InheritedWidget API.
Indeed, it is good to keep in mind that, inherently, Provider is a "simpler InheritedWidget".
Provider is merely an InheritedWidget wrapper, and thus it's limited by it.

By the end of this read you should be convinced that Riverpod should be used instead of Provider. 
**Riverpod is the more modern, recommended and reliable approach**, whereas Provider is currently lacking in many areas with no way forward.

Such limitations include the following.

## The relationship between Riverpod and Provider

Riverpod is designed to be the spiritual successor of Provider. Hence the
name "Riverpod", which is an anagram of "Provider".

Riverpod was born while searching for solutions to the various technical
limitations that Provider face. Originally, Riverpod was supposed to be a
major version of Provider as a way to solve this problem. But it was
decided against as this would be a decently big breaking change, and
Provider is one of the most used Flutter packages.

Still, conceptually, Riverpod and Provider are fairly similar.  
Both packages fill a similar role. Both try to:

- cache and dispose some stateful objects
- offer a way to mock those objects during tests
- offer a way for Widgets to listen to those objects in a simple way.

At the same time, think of Riverpod as what Provider could've been if
it continued to mature for a few years.

Riverpod fixes various fundamental problems with Provider, such as but not limited to:

- Significantly simplifying the combination of "providers".
  Instead of the tedious and error-prone `ProxyProvider`, Riverpod exposes
  simple yet powerful utilites such as [ref.watch] and [ref.listen].
- Allowing multiple "provider" to expose a value of the same type.  
  This removes the need for defining custom classes when exposing a
  plain `int` or `String` would work just as well.
- Removing the need to re-define providers inside tests.
  With Riverpod, providers are ready to use inside tests by default.
- Reducing the over-reliance on "scoping" to dispose objects by offering
  alternate ways to dispose objects ([autoDispose])
  While powerful, scoping a provider is fairly advanced and hard to get right.

... And a lot more.

The only true downside of Riverpod is that it requires changing the widget type
to work:

- Instead of extending `StatelessWidget`, with Riverpod you should extend
  `ConsumerWidget`.
- Instead of extending `StatefulWidget`, with Riverpod you should extend
  `ConsumerStatefulWidget`.

But this inconvenience is fairly minor in the grand scheme of things. And this
requirement might one day disappear.

So to answer the question you're probably asking yourself:  
**Should I use Provider or Riverpod?**

You probably should be using Riverpod.  
Riverpod is overhaul better designed and could lead to drastic simplifications
of your logic.

## The difference between Provider and Riverpod

### Defining providers

The primary difference between both packages is how "providers" are defined.

With [Provider], providers are widgets and as such placed inside the widget tree,
typically inside a `MultiProvider`:

```dart
class Counter extends ChangeNotifier {
 ...
}

void main() {
  runApp(
    MultiProvider(
      providers: [
        ChangeNotifierProvider<Counter>(create: (context) => Counter()),
      ],
      child: MyApp(),
    )
  );
}
```

With Riverpod, providers are **not** widgets. Instead they are plain Dart objects.  
Similarly, providers are defined outside of the widget tree, and instead are declared
as global final variables.

Also, for Riverpod to work, it is necessary to add a `ProviderScope` widget above the
entire application. As such, the equivalent of the Provider example using Riverpod
would be:

```dart
// Providers are now top-level variables
final counterProvider = ChangeNotifierProvider<Counter>((ref) => Counter());

void main() {
  runApp(
    // This widget enables Riverpod for the entire project
    ProviderScope(
      child: MyApp(),
    ),
  );
}
```

Notice how the provider definition simply moved up a few lines.

:::info
Since with Riverpod providers are plain Dart objects, it is possible to use
Riverpod without Flutter.  
For example, Riverpod can be used to write command line applications.

### Reading providers: BuildContext

With Provider, one way of reading providers is to use a Widget's `BuildContext`.

For example, if a provider was defined as:

```dart
Provider<Model>(...);
```

then reading it using [Provider] is done with:

```dart
class Example extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    Model model = context.watch<Model>();

  }
}
```

The equivalent in Riverpod would be:

```dart
final modelProvider = Provider<Model>(...);

class Example extends ConsumerWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
    Model model = ref.watch(modelProvider);

  }
}
```

Notice how:

- Riverpod's snippet extends `ConsumerWidget` instead of `StatelessWidget`.
  That different widget type adds one extra parameter to our `build` function:
  `WidgetRef`.

- Instead of `BuildContext.watch`, in Riverpod we do `WidgetRef.watch`, using
  the `WidgetRef` which we obtained from `ConsumerWidget`.

- Riverpod does not rely on generic types. Instead it relies on the variable
  created using provider definition.

Notice too how similar the wording is. Both Provider and Riverpod use the keyword
"watch" to describe "this widget should rebuild when the value changes".

:::info
Riverpod uses the same terminology as Provider for reading providers.

- `BuildContext.watch` -> `WidgetRef.watch`
- `BuildContext.read` -> `WidgetRef.read`

The rules for `context.watch` vs `context.read` applies to Riverpod too:  
Inside the `build` method, use "watch". Inside click handlers and other events,
use "read".
:::

### Reading providers: Consumer

Provider optionally comes with a widget named `Consumer` (and variants such as `Consumer2`)
for reading providers.

`Consumer` is helpful as a performance optimization, by allowing more granular rebuilds
of the widget tree – updating only the revelant widgets when the state changes:

As such, if a provider was defined as:

```dart
Provider<Model>(...);
```

Provider allows reading that provider using `Consumer` with:

```dart
Consumer<Model>(
  builder: (BuildContext context, Model model, Widget? child) {

  }
)
```

Riverpod has the same principle. Riverpod, too, has a widget named `Consumer`
for the exact same purpose.

If we defined a provider as:

```dart
final modelProvider = Provider<Model>(...);
```

Then using `Consumer` we could do:

```dart
Consumer(
  builder: (BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref, Widget? child) {
    Model model = ref.watch(modelProvider);

  }
)
```

Notice how `Consumer` gives us a `WidgetRef` object. This is the same object
as we saw in the previous part related to `ConsumerWidget`.

### Combining providers: ProxyProvider with stateless objects

When using Provider, the official way of combining providers is using the
`ProxyProvider` widget (or variants such as `ProxyProvider2`).

For example we may define:

```dart
class UserIdNotifier extends ChangeNotifier {
  String? userId;
}

// ...

ChangeNotifierProvider<UserIdNotifier>(create: (context) => UserIdNotifier()),
```

From there we have two options. We may combine `UserIdNotifier` to create a new
"stateless" provider (typically an immutable value that possibly override ==).
Such as:

```dart
ProxyProvider<UserIdNotifier, String>(
  update: (context, userIdNotifier, _) {
    return 'The user ID of the the user is ${userIdNotifier.userId}';
  }
)
```

This provider would automatically return a new `String` whenever
`UserIdNotifier.userId` changes.

We can do something similar in Riverpod, but the syntax is different.  
First, in Riverpod, the definition of our `UserIdNotifier` would be:

```dart
class UserIdNotifier extends ChangeNotifier {
  String? userId;
}

// ...

final userIdNotifierProvider = ChangeNotifierProvider<UserIdNotifier>(
  (ref) => UserIdNotifier(),
);
```

From there, to generate our `String` based on the `userId`, we could do:

```dart
final labelProvider = Provider<String>((ref) {
  UserIdNotifier userIdNotifier = ref.watch(userIdNotifierProvider);
  return 'The user ID of the the user is ${userIdNotifier.userId}';
});
```

Notice the line doing `ref.watch(userIdNotifierProvider)`.

This line of code tells Riverpod to obtain the content of the `userIdNotifierProvider`
and that whenever that value changes, `labelProvider` will be recomputed too.
As such, the `String` emitted by our `labelProvider` will automatically update
whenever the `userId` changes.

This `ref.watch` line should feel similar. This pattern was covered previously
when explaining [how to read providers inside widgets](#reading-providers-buildcontext).
Indeed, providers are now able to listen to other providers in the same way
that widgets do.

### Combining providers: ProxyProvider with stateful objects

When combining providers, another alternative use-case is to expose
stateful objects, such as a `ChangeNotifier` instance.

For that, we could use `ChangeNotifierProxyProvider` (or variants such as `ChangeNotifierProxyProvider2`).  
For example we may define:

```dart
class UserIdNotifier extends ChangeNotifier {
  String? userId;
}

// ...

ChangeNotifierProvider<UserIdNotifier>(create: (context) => UserIdNotifier()),
```

Then, we can define a new `ChangeNotifier` that is based on `UserIdNotifier.userId`.
For example we could do:

```dart
class UserNotifier extends ChangeNotifier {
  String? _userId;

  void setUserId(String? userId) {
    if (userId != _userId) {
      print('The user ID changed from $_userId to $userId');
      _userId = userId;
    }
  }
}

// ...

ChangeNotifierProxyProvider<UserIdNotifier, UserNotifier>(
  create: (context) => UserNotifier(),
  update: (context, userIdNotifier, userNotifier) {
    return userNotifier!
      ..setUserId(userIdNotifier.userId);
  },
);
```

This new provider creates a single instance of `UserNotifier` (which is never re-constructed)
and prints a string whenever the user ID changes.

Doing the same thing in provider is achieved differently.
First, in Riverpod, the definition of our `UserIdNotifier` would be:

```dart
class UserIdNotifier extends ChangeNotifier {
  String? userId;
}

// ...

final userIdNotifierProvider = ChangeNotifierProvider<UserIdNotifier>(
  (ref) => UserIdNotifier(),
),
```

From there, the equivalent to the previous `ChangeNotifierProxyProvider` would be:

```dart
class UserNotifier extends ChangeNotifier {
  String? _userId;

  void setUserId(String? userId) {
    if (userId != _userId) {
      print('The user ID changed from $_userId to $userId');
      _userId = userId;
    }
  }
}

// ...

final userNotifierProvider = ChangeNotifierProvider<UserNotifier>((ref) {
  final userNotifier = UserNotifier();
  ref.listen<UserIdNotifier>(
    userIdNotifierProvider,
    (previous, next) {
      if (previous?.userId != next.userId) {
        userNotifier.setUserId(next.userId);
      }
    },
  );

  return userNotifier;
});
```

The core of this snippet is the `ref.listen` line.  
This `ref.listen` function is a utility that allows listening to a provider,
and whenever the provider changes, executes a function.

The `previous` and `next` parameters of that function correspond to the
last value before the provider changed and the new value after it changed.
