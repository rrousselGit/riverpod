title: Migrating from 2.0 to 3.0
---
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import { AutoSnippet } from "/src/components/CodeSnippet";

For the list of changes, please refer to the [What's new in Riverpod 3.0](whats_new) page.

Riverpod 3.0 introduces a number of breaking changes that may require you to update your code.
They should in general be relatively minor, but we recommend you to read this page carefully.

:::info
This migration is supposed to be smooth.  
If there is anything that is unclear, or if you encountered a scenario that is difficult
to migrate, please [open an issue](https://github.com/rrousselGit/riverpod/issues/new/choose)).

It is important to us that the migration is as smooth as possible, so we will do our best to help you ; 
improve the migration guide ; or even include helpers to make the migration easier.

## Automatic retry

Riverpod 3.0 now [automatically retries](./whats_new.mdx#automatic-retry) failing providers by default.
This means that if a provider fails to compute its value, it will automatically retry until it succeeds.

In general, this is a good thing as it makes your app more resilient to transient errors.
However, you may want to disable/customize this behavior in some cases.

To disable automatic retry globally, you can do so on `ProviderContainer`/`ProviderScope`:


<Tabs>
<TabItem value="ProviderScope" label="ProviderScope" defaultValue>

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(
    ProviderScope(
      // Never retry any provider
      retry: (retryCount, error) => null,
      child: MyApp(),
    ),
  );
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ProviderContainer" label="ProviderContainer" defaultValue>

```dart
void main() {
  final container = ProviderContainer(
    // Never retry any provider
    retry: (retryCount, error) {
      if (error is SomeSpecificError) return null;
      if (retryCount > 5) return null;

      return Duration(seconds: retryCount * 2);
    },
  );
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Alternatively, you can disable automatic retry on a per-provider basis by using the `retry` parameter of the provider:

<AutoSnippet
  language="dart"
  codegen={`
  // Never retry this specific provider
  Duration? retry(int retryCount, Object error) => null;
  
  @Riverpod(retry: retry)
  class TodoList extends _$TodoList {
    @override
    List<Todo> build() => [];
  }
  `}
  
  raw={`
  final todoListProvider = NotifierProvider<TodoList, List<Todo>>(
    TodoList.new,
    // Never retry this specific provider
    retry: (retryCount, error) => null,
  );
  `}
></AutoSnippet>

## Out of view providers are paused

In Riverpod 3.0, [out of view providers are paused by default](./whats_new.mdx#listeners-inside-widgets-that-are-not-visible-are-now-paused).

There is currently no way to disable this behavior globally, but you can control
the pause behavior at the consumer level by using the [TickerMode] widget.

```dart
class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return TickerMode(
      enabled: false, // This will pause the listeners
      child: Consumer(
        builder: (context, ref, child) {
          // This "watch" will be paused
          // until TickerMode is set to true
          final value = ref.watch(myProvider);
          return Text(value.toString());
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## StateProvider, StateNotifierProvider, and ChangeNotifierProvider are moved to a new import

In Riverpod 3.0, `StateProvider`, `StateNotifierProvider`, and `ChangeNotifierProvider` are considered "legacy".  
They are not removed, but are no-longer part of the main API. This is to discourage their use
in favor of the new `Notifier` API.

To keep using them, you need to change your imports to one of the following:

```dart
import 'package:hooks_riverpod/legacy.dart';
import 'package:flutter_riverpod/legacy.dart';
import 'package:riverpod/legacy.dart';
```

## Providers now all use == to filter updates

Before, Riverpod was inconsistent in how it filtered updates to providers.
Some providers used `==` to filter updates, while others used `identical`.
In Riverpod 3.0, [all providers now use `==` to filter updates](./whats_new.mdx#all-updateshouldnotify-now-use-).

This generally shouldn't change anything in your code. But if you need to,
you can override `Notifier.updateShouldNotify` to customize the behavior.

<AutoSnippet
  language="dart"
  codegen={`
  @riverpod
  class TodoList extends _$TodoList {
    @override
    List<Todo> build() => [];
  
    @override
    bool updateShouldNotify(List<Todo> previous, List<Todo> next) {
      // Custom implementation
      return true;
    }
  }
  `}
  
  raw={`
  class TodoList extends Notifier<List<Todo>> {
    @override
    List<Todo> build() => [];
  
    @override
    bool updateShouldNotify(List<Todo> previous, List<Todo> next) {
      // Custom implementation
      return true;
    }
  }
  `}
></AutoSnippet>


In the scenario where you didn't use a `Notifier`, you can refactor your provider in its notifier equivalent
(Such as converting [StreamProvider] to [StreamNotifierProvider]).


## ProviderObserver has its interface slightly changed

For the sake of [mutations](./whats_new.mdx#mutations-experimental-code-generation-only), 
the [ProviderObserver] interface has changed slightly.

Instead of two separate parameters for [ProviderContainer] and [ProviderBase], 
a single `ProviderObserverContext` object is passed.
This object contains both the container, provider, and extra information (such as the associated mutation).

To migrate, you need to update all methods of your observers like so:

```diff
class MyObserver extends ProviderObserver {
  @override
-  void didAddProvider(ProviderBase provider, Object? value, ProviderContainer container) {
+  void didAddProvider(ProviderObserverContext context, Object? value) {
    // ...
  }
}
```

## Simplified Ref and removed Ref subclasses

For the sake of simplification, [Ref] lost its type parameter. And all properties/methods that were
using the type parameter have been moved to [Notifier]s.  

Specifically, `ProviderRef.state`, `Ref.listenSelf` and `FutureProviderRef.future` should be replaced by
`Notifier.state`, `Notifier.listenSelf` and `FutureProviderRef.future` respectively.

<AutoSnippet
  language="dart"
  codegen={`
  // Before:
  @override
  Future<int> value(ValueRef ref) async {
    ref.listen(anotherProvider, (previous, next) {
      ref.state++;
    });
    
    ref.listenSelf((previous, next) {
      print('Log: $previous -> $next');
    });
    
    ref.future.then((value) {
      print('Future: $value');
    });
  
    return 0;
  }
  
  // After
  @riverpod
  class Value extends _$Value {
    @override
    Future<int> build() async {
      ref.listen(anotherProvider, (previous, next) {
        ref.state++;
      });
    
      listenSelf((previous, next) {
        print('Log: $previous -> $next');
      });
    
      future.then((value) {
        print('Future: $value');
      });
    
      return 0;
    }
  }
  `}
  
  raw={`
  // Before:
  final valueProvider = FutureProvider<int>((ref) async {
    ref.listen(anotherProvider, (previous, next) {
      ref.state++;
    });
    
    ref.listenSelf((previous, next) {
      print('Log: $previous -> $next');
    });
    
    ref.future.then((value) {
      print('Future: $value');
    });
  
    return 0;
  });
  
  // After
  class Value extends AsyncNotifier<int> {
    @override
    Future<int> build() async {
      ref.listen(anotherProvider, (previous, next) {
        ref.state++;
      });
    
      listenSelf((previous, next) {
        print('Log: $previous -> $next');
      });
    
      future.then((value) {
        print('Future: $value');
      });
    
      return 0;
    }
  }
  final valueProvider = AsyncNotifierProvider<Value, int>(Value.new);
  `}
></AutoSnippet>

Similarly, all [Ref] subclasses are removed (such as but not limited to `ProviderRef`, `FutureProviderRef`, etc).

This primarily affects code-generation. Instead of `MyProviderRef`, you can now use `Ref` directly:

```diff
@riverpod
-int example(ExampleRef ref) {
+int example(Ref ref) {
  // ...
}
```

## AutoDispose interfaces are moved

The auto-dispose feature is simplified. Instead of relying on a clone of all interfaces,
interfaces are unified.

In short, instead of `AutoDisposeProvider`, `AutoDisposeNotifier`, etc, you now have `Provider`, `Notifier`, etc.
The behavior is the same, but the API is simplified.

To easily migrate, you can do a case-sensitive replace of `AutoDispose` to ` ` (empty string).

## Provider failures are now rethrown as ProviderExceptions

In Riverpod 3.0, all provider failures are [rethrown as `ProviderException`s](./whats_new.mdx#when-reading-a-provider-results-in-an-exception-the-error-is-now-wrapped-in-a-providerexception). 
This means that if a provider fails to compute its value, reading it will throw a `ProviderException` instead of the original error.

This can impact you if you were relying on the original error type to handle specific errors.
To migrate, you can catch the `ProviderException` and extract the original error from it:

```diff
try {
  await ref.read(myProvider.future);
-} on NotFoundException {
-  // Handle NotFoundException
+} on ProviderException catch (e) {
+  if (e.exception is NotFoundException) {
+    // Handle NotFoundException
+  }
}
```

:::info
This is only necessary if you were explicitly relying on try/catch to handle such error.

If you are using [AsyncValue] to check for errors, you don't need to change anything:

```dart
AsyncValue<int> value = ref.watch(myProvider);
if (value.error is NotFoundException) {
  // Handle NotFoundException
  // This still works today
}
```
