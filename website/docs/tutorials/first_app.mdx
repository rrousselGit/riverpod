In this tutorial, we will build a random joke generator app using Riverpod:

<DartPad id="6bf918e3fc97a40b53d1ea80fd937146" />

## Key points
- Learn to install Riverpod
- Create your first provider to make a network request
- Use [Consumer] to display the data
- Handle [AsyncValue] to display loading and error states

## Setting up the project

### Creating a Flutter project

To start, let's create a new Flutter project:

```sh
flutter create first_app
```

Then, open the project in your favorite editor.

### Creating a mocked UI

Before we start to write any form of logic, let's create the UI of our app.
Instead of using a real API, we will start with static data.

Let's create a new file called `home.dart` in the `lib` directory of our project.
In it, you can paste the following code:

<AutoSnippet
  title="lib/home.dart"
  raw={`
  import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
  
  class HomeView extends StatelessWidget {
    const HomeView({super.key});
  
    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      return Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: const Text('Random Joke Generator')),
        body: SizedBox.expand(
          child: Stack(
            alignment: Alignment.center,
            children: [
              const SelectableText(
                'What kind of bagel can fly?\\n\\n'
                'A plain bagel.',
                textAlign: TextAlign.center,
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
              ),
  
              Positioned(
                bottom: 20,
                child: ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: () {},
                  child: const Text('Get another joke'),
                ),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      );
    }
  }
`}
/>

Then, we can update our `main.dart` file to use this new `HomeView` widget:

<AutoSnippet
  title="lib/main.dart"
  raw={`
  import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
  
  import 'home.dart';
  
  void main() {
    runApp(const MyApp());
  }
  
  class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
    const MyApp({super.key});
  
    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      return const MaterialApp(home: HomeView());
    }
  }
`}
/>

If you run the app now, you show see the following:

### Adding Riverpod to the project

After creating the project, we need to add Riverpod as a dependency.

We will be using Riverpod and Flutter, so we will install the [flutter_riverpod] package.  
Similarly, we will be performing network requests using the [Dio] package, so we will install that as well.

You can do so by typing the following command in your terminal:

```sh
flutter pub add flutter_riverpod dio
```

This will add the latest version of Riverpod to your project, along with Dio.

### (Optional) Adding riverpod_lint

To help you write better Riverpod code, you can install the [riverpod_lint] package.  
This package provides a set of refactors to more easily write Riverpod code, as well as a set of lints to help you avoid common mistakes.

You can install it by running the following command:

```sh
flutter pub add --dev riverpod_lint custom_lint
```

Then, you can enable it by updating the `analysis_options.yaml` file next to your `pubspec.yaml` to include the following:

```yaml
analyzer:
  plugins:
    - custom_lint
```

### Adding ProviderScope in our main function

For Riverpod to work, we need to update our `main` function to include a `[ProviderScope]`.  
You can learn about those objects in the <Link documentID="concepts2/containers" /> section.

Here's the updated `main` function:

<AutoSnippet
  title="lib/main.dart"
  raw={`
void main() {
  runApp(
    // Add ProviderScope above your app
    // highlight-next-line
    const ProviderScope(
      child: MyApp(),
    ),
  );
}
  `}
/>

## Creating a model class

In this tutorial, we will fetch data from a [Random Joke generator](https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/random_joke) API.

This API returns a JSON object that looks like this:

```json
{
  "type": "general",
  "setup": "Why did the scarecrow win an award?",
  "punchline": "Because he was outstanding in his field.",
  "id": 333
}
```

To represent this data in our app, we will create a model class called `Joke`.  

For this, let's create a new file called `joke.dart` in the `lib` directory of our project.
Here's how the `Joke` class looks like:

<AutoSnippet
  title="lib/joke.dart"
  raw={`
class Joke {
  Joke({
    required this.type,
    required this.setup,
    required this.punchline,
    required this.id,
  });
  
  factory Joke.fromJson(Map<String, Object?> json) {
    return Joke(
      type: json['type']! as String,
      setup: json['setup']! as String,
      punchline: json['punchline']! as String,
      id: json['id']! as int,
    );
  }
  
  final String type;
  final String setup;
  final String punchline;
  final int id;
}
  `}
/>


Notice the `fromJson` factory constructor.  
Since our API returns a JSON object, we need a way to convert JSON data into our `Joke` class.
This constructor takes a `Map<String, Object?>` and returns a `Joke` instance.

## Writing a function that calls the API.

Now that we have our model class, we can write a function that fetches the data from the API.
We will use the [Dio] package here, because it naturally throws if a request fails, which is convenient for our use case.
But you can use any HTTP client you prefer.

We can place that logic in the `joke.dart` file we just created,
as this logic is closely related to the `Joke` class.

<AutoSnippet
  title="lib/joke.dart"
  raw={`
  final dio = Dio();
  
  Future<Joke> fetchRandomJoke() async {
    // Fetching a random joke from a public API
    final response = await dio.get<Map<String, Object?>>(
      'https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/random_joke',
    );
  
    return Joke.fromJson(response.data!);
  }
  `}
/>

:::info
Notice how we did not catch any error from the API call.  
This is on purpose. Riverpod will handle errors for us, so we don't need to do it manually.
:::

## Creating a provider that fetches the data

Now that we have a function to query the API, we can create a "provider" responsible for
caching the result of that API.  
See <Link documentID="concepts2/providers" /> for more information about them.

Since our `fetchRandomJoke` function returns a `Future<Joke>`, we will use [FutureProvider].
We can place the provider in the same `joke.dart` file, as it is also related to the `Hoke` class.

By doing this, the execution of `fetchRandomJoke` will be cached, and regardless of how
many times we access to the value, the network request will only be performed once.

<AutoSnippet
  title="lib/joke.dart"
  raw={`
  final randomJokeProvider = FutureProvider<Joke>((ref) async {
    // Using the fetchRandomJoke function to get a random joke
    return fetchRandomJoke();
  });
  `}
/>

:::info
The separation between our `fetchRandomJoke` function and the `randomJokeProvider` is not mandatory.  
You can directly write the content of `fetchRandomJoke` inside the provider if you prefer:

```dart
final randomJokeProvider = FutureProvider<Joke>((ref) async {
  final response = await dio.get<Map<String, Object?>>(
    'https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/random_joke',
  );

  return Joke.fromJson(response.data!);
});
```
:::

## Displaying the data in the UI

### Wrapping our UI in a Consumer

Now that we have a provider, it is time to update our `HomeView` widget to dynamically load data.

To do so, we will need another feature of Riverpod: the [Consumer] widget.  
This widget allows us to read the value of a provider and rebuild the UI when the value changes.
It is used in a manner that is reminiscent of widgets such like [StreamBuilder].

Specifically, we will want to encapsulate the `Stack` in a `Consumer` widget.  
If you have installed [riverpod_lint] in the earlier step, you can use one of the built-in refactors:

![Wrap in Consumer refactor in action](/img/tutorials/first_app/wrap_in_consumer.gif)

The updated `home.dart` code should look like this:

<AutoSnippet
  title="lib/home.dart"
  raw={`
  import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
  import 'package:flutter_riverpod/flutter_riverpod.dart';
  
  class HomeView extends StatelessWidget {
    const HomeView({super.key});
  
    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      return Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: const Text('Random Joke Generator')),
        body: SizedBox.expand(
          // highlight-next-line
          child: Consumer(
            // highlight-next-line
            builder: (context, ref, child) {
              return Stack(
                alignment: Alignment.center,
                children: [
                  const SelectableText(
                    'What kind of bagel can fly?\\n\\n'
                    'A plain bagel.',
                    textAlign: TextAlign.center,
                    style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
                  ),
  
                  Positioned(
                    bottom: 20,
                    child: ElevatedButton(
                      onPressed: () {},
                      child: const Text('Get another joke'),
                    ),
                  ),
                ],
              );
            },
          ),
        ),
      );
    }
  }
  `}
/>

### Obtaining our joke and listening to its changes

Now that we have a `Consumer`, we can use its `ref` parameter to read our provider.  
Using this object, we can call `ref.watch(randomJokeProvider)` to obtain the current value of the provider.
But there are other ways to interact with providers! See <Link documentID="concepts2/refs" /> for more information.

Our updated `Consumer` should look like this:

```dart
Consumer(
  builder: (context, ref, child) {
    // highlight-next-line
    final randomJoke = ref.watch(randomJokeProvider);
    // ...
  },
)
```

With this line, Riverpod will automatically fetch the joke from our API and cache the result.
We can now use the `randomJoke` variable to display the joke in our UI.

### Handling loading and error states

The `randomJoke` variable we created earlier is not of type `Joke`, but rather of type `AsyncValue<Joke>`.  
[AsyncValue] is a Riverpod type that represents the state of an asynchronous operation, such as a network request.
It includes information about loading, success, and error states. `AsyncValue` is in many ways similar to the `AsyncSnapshot` type used in [StreamBuilder].

A convenient way to handle the different states is to use Dart's `switch` feature. It is similar to an
`if`/`else if` chain, but tailored for handling conditions on one specific object.

A common way to use it when combined with `AsyncValue` is as follows:

```dart
switch (asyncValue) {
  // If "value" is non-null, it means that we have some data.
  case AsyncValue(:final value?):
    return Text(value);
  // If "error" is non-null, it means that the operation failed.
  case AsyncValue(error: != null):
    return Text('Error: ${asyncValue.error}');
  // If we're neither in data state nor in error state, then we're in loading state.
  case AsyncValue():
    return const CircularProgressIndicator();
}
```

:::caution
The order of operation matters!  
If using the syntax used above, it is important to check for values 
_before_ checking for errors and to handle the loading state last.

If using a different order, you may see incorrect behavior, such as
showing a progress indicator when the request has already completed.
:::


We can now update our `Stack` to display the joke, loading indicator, or error message based on the state of `randomJoke`:

<AutoSnippet
  raw={`
  return Stack(
    alignment: Alignment.center,
    children: [
      switch (randomJoke) {
        // When the request completes successfully, we display the joke.
        AsyncValue(:final value?) => SelectableText(
          '$\{value.setup}\\n\\n$\{value.punchline}',
          textAlign: TextAlign.center,
          style: const TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
        // On error, we display a simple error message.
        AsyncValue(error: != null) => const Text('Error fetching joke'),
        // While the request is loading, we display a progress indicator.
        AsyncValue() => const CircularProgressIndicator(),
      },
  
      // <code for the button remains unchanged>
    ],
  );
`}
/>


At this stage, our application is connected to internet and a random joke is displayed when the app is launched!

### Connecting the "Get another joke" button

Currently, we display a random joke when the app is launched, but clicking on the
button does nothing. Let's update the button to fetch a new joke when clicked.

We _could_ use a pattern similar to [ChangeNotifier] and manually handle the state.  
Riverpod supports such patterns, but it is not necessary here.

Instead, we can tell Riverpod to re-execute the logic of our provider when the button is clicked.
This can be done by using [Ref.invalidate] like so:

```dart
ElevatedButton(
  // highlight-next-line
  onPressed: () => ref.invalidate(randomJokeProvider),
  child: const Text('Get another joke'),
),
```

That is all we need to do!  
When the button is clicked, Riverpod will re-execute the logic of `randomJokeProvider`, which will
fetch a new joke from the API and update the UI accordingly.

### Adding a `LinearProgressIndicator` when a new joke is being fetched

You may have noticed that when clicking on the "Get another joke" button, the app does not show any loading indicator.

This is because when we call [Ref.invalidate], the existing cache is not destroyed.
Instead, while the new joke is being fetched, we retain information about the previous joke.
This allows us to display the previous joke while the new one is being fetched.

However, UIs may want to handle those cases and show both a loading indicator and the previous joke.
A [LinearProgressIndicator] is a common way to do so. To add this indicator, we can check
[AsyncValue.isReloading]. This flag is `true` when old data is available and a new request is being made.

Our updated `Stack` should look like this:

```dart
return Stack(
  alignment: Alignment.center,
  children: [
    // During the second request, we show a special loading indicator
    // highlight-next-line
    if (randomJoke.isRefreshing)
      const Positioned(
        top: 0,
        left: 0,
        right: 0,
        child: LinearProgressIndicator(),
      ),

    // Show the data and button like before
  ],
);
```

That's all!  
We now have a fully functional random joke generator app that fetches jokes from an API and displays them in the UI.  
And we have handled all edge-cases, such as loading and error states.

Notice how we never had to write a `try/catch` or write code such as `isLoading = true/false`.
