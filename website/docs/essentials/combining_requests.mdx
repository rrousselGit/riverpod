Up until now, we've only seen cases where requests are independent of each
other. But a common use-case is to have to trigger a request based on the
result of another request.

We _could_ be using the <Link documentID="essentials/passing_args" /> mechanism to
do that, by passing the result of a provider as a parameter to another provider.

But this approach has a few downsides:

- This leaks implementation details.
  Now, your UI needs to know about all the providers that are used
  by your other provider.
- Whenever the parameter changes, a brand new state will be created.
  By passing parameters, there is no way to keep the previous state
  when the parameter changes.
- It makes combining requests harder.
- This makes tooling less useful. A devtool wouldn't
  know about the relationship between providers.

To improve this, Riverpod offers a different approach to combining requests.

## The basics: Obtaining a "ref"

All possible ways of combining requests have one thing in common:
They are all based on the `Ref` object.

The `Ref` object is an object to which all providers have access.
It grants them access to various life-cycle listeners, but also
various methods to combine providers.

The place where `Ref` can be obtained depends on the type of provider.

In functional providers, the `Ref` is passed as a parameter to the
provider's function:

<AutoSnippet {...functionalRef} />

In class variants, the `Ref` is a property of the Notifier class:

<AutoSnippet {...notifierRef} />

## Using ref to read a provider.

## The `ref.watch` method.

Now that we've obtained a `Ref`, we can use it to combine requests.
The main way to do so is by using `ref.watch`.  
It is generally recommended to architecture your code such that you
can use `ref.watch` over other options, as it is generally easier to maintain.

The `ref.watch` method takes a provider, and returns its current state.
Then, whenever the listened provider changes, our provider will be
invalidated and rebuilt next frame or on next read.

By using `ref.watch`, your logic becomes both "reactive" and "declarative".  
Meaning that your logic will automatically recompute when needed.
And that the update mechanism doesn't rely on side-effects, such as an "on change".
This is similar to how StatelessWidgets behave.

As an example, we could define a provider that listens to the user's location.
Then, we could use this location to fetch the list of restaurants near the user.

<AutoSnippet {...watchExample} />

:::info
When the listened to provider changes and our request recomputes, the previous
state is kept until the new request is completed.  
At the same time, while the request is pending, the "isLoading" and "isReloading"
flags will be set.

This enables UI to either show the previous state or a loading indicator,
or even both.
:::

:::info
Notice how we used `ref.watch(locationProvider.future)` instead of `ref.watch(locationProvider)`.
That is because our `locationProvider` is asynchronous. As such, we want to
await for an initial value to be available.

If we omit that `.future`, we would receive an `AsyncValue`, which is a snapshot
of the current state of the `locationProvider`. But if no location is available yet,
we won't be able to do anything.
:::

:::caution
It is considered bad practice to call `ref.watch` inside code that is executed
"imperatively". Meaning any code that is possibly not executed during the build
phase of the provider. This includes "listener" callbacks or methods on Notifiers:

<AutoSnippet {...watchPlacement} />
:::

## The `ref.listen`/`listenSelf` methods.

The `ref.listen` method is an alternative to `ref.watch`.  
It is similar to your traditional "listen"/"addListener" method. It takes a provider
and a callback, and will invoke said callback whenever the content of the provider
changes.

Refactoring your code such that you can use `ref.watch` instead of `ref.listen`
is generally recommended, as the latter is more error-prone due to its imperative nature.  
But `ref.listen` can be helpful to add some quick logic without having to do
significant refactor.

We could rewrite the `ref.watch` example to use `ref.listen` instead

<AutoSnippet {...listenExample} />

:::info
It is entirely safe to use `ref.listen` during the build phase of a provider.
If the provider somehow is recomputed, previous listeners will be removed.

Alternatively, you can use the return value of `ref.listen` to remove the listener
manually when you wish.
:::

## The `ref.read` method.

The last option available is `ref.read`.
It is similar to `ref.watch` in that it returns the current state of a provider.
But unlike `ref.watch`, it doesn't listen to the provider.

As such, `ref.read` should only be used in places where you can't use
`ref.watch`, such as inside methods of Notifiers.

<AutoSnippet {...readExample} />

:::caution
Be careful when using `ref.read` on a provider as, since it doesn't listen to the
provider, said provider may decide to destroy its state if it isn't listened.
