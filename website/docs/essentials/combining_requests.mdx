title: Combining requests (WIP)
version: 1
---

:::note
This page is a work in progress
:::

- [ ] Mention that some network requests may depend on the result of
      other requests. For example, a request to get the list of cities
      near the user would depend on a request to get the user's location.

- [ ] Mention that there are two primary ways to combine requests:

  - [ ] `ref.watch` - declarative approach, will automatically recompute the request on change
    - [ ] Mention that this is the recommended approach due to simplified error handling
          & automatic recomputation.
  - [ ] `ref.listen` - imperative approach, will invoke a listener when the result changes.
        It is then up to the listener to perform changes, such as maybe calling `ref.state=`.
    - [ ] Link Provider migration guide, to showcase how using ref.listen
          can be used to migrate ProxyProviders to Riverpod

- [ ] A `ref` is always available when defining a provider:
  - it is either passed as parameter to the provider's function
  - or it is a property of the Notifier class.
