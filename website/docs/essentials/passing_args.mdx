This page is a work in progress

TODO:

- [ ] Reuse the `FutureProvider` from the previous example
- [ ] Add an argument to filter the category of activity generated
- [ ] Update Consumers to pass the argument to the requests
- [ ] Mention how it is possible to listen to the same provider
      with different arguments simultaneously
- [ ] Mention how it is important for parameters to have consistent equality
  - [ ] Recommend using riverpod_lint's lint to ensure consistent equality
- [ ] Showcase how using Dart 3 records can allow passing multiple arguments
      without having to create a class
