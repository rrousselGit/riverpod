So far, we've seen how to create/update some state.
But we have yet to talk about when state destruction occurs.

Riverpod offers various ways to interact with state disposal.
This ranges from delaying the disposal of state to reacting to destruction.

## When is state destroyed and how to change this?

<When codegen={true}>

When using code-generation, by default, the state is destroyed when
the provider stops being listened to.  
This happens when a listener has no active listener for a full frame.
When that happens, the state is destroyed.

This behavior can be opted out by using `keepAlive: true`.  
Doing so will prevent the state from getting destroyed when all listeners
are removed.

<AutoSnippet raw={codegenKeepAlive} />

</When>

<When codegen={false}>

When not using code-generation, by default the state isn't destroyed
when the provider stops being listened.

You can optionally change this behavior and use automatic disposal.
When doing so, Riverpod will track whether a provider has listeners or not.
Then, if the provider has no listeners for a full frame, the state will be destroyed.

To enable automatic disposal, you can use `.autoDispose` next to the provider type:

<AutoSnippet raw={rawAutoDispose} />

</When>

:::note
Enabling/disabling automatic disposal has no impact on whether or not
the state is destroyed when the provider is recomputed.  
The state will always be destroyed when the provider is recomputed.
:::

:::caution
When providers receive parameters, it is recommended to enable automatic disposal.
That is because otherwise, one state per parameter combination will be created,
which can lead to memory leaks.

## Reacting to state disposal

In Riverpod, there are a few built-in ways for state to be destroyed:

- The provider is no longer used and is in "auto dispose" mode (more on that later).
  In this case, all associated state with the provider is destroyed.
- The provider is recomputed, such as with `ref.watch`.
  In that case, the previous state is disposed, and a new state is created.

In both cases. you may want to execute some logic when that happens.  
This can be achieved with `ref.onDispose`. This methods enables
registering a listener to whenever the state is destroyed.

For example, you may want use it to close any active `StreamController`:

<AutoSnippet {...onDisposeExample} />

:::caution
The callback of `ref.onDispose` must not trigger side-effects.
Modifying providers inside `onDispose` could lead to unexpected behavior.
:::

:::info
There are other useful life-cycles such as:

- `ref.onCancel` which is called when the last listener of a provider is removed.
- `ref.onResume` which is called when a new listener is added after `onCancel` was invoked.

:::

:::info
You can call `ref.onDispose` as many times as you wish.
Feel free to call it once per disposable object in your provider. This practice
makes it easier to spot when we forget to dispose of something.
:::

## Manually forcing the destruction of a provider, using `ref.invalidate`

Sometimes, you may want to force the destruction of a provider.
This can be done by using `ref.invalidate`, which can be called from another
provider or a widget.

Using `ref.invalidate` will destroy the current provider state.
There are then two possible outcomes:

- If the provider is listened to, a new state will be created.
- If the provider is not listened to, the provider will be fully destroyed.

<AutoSnippet raw={invalidateExample} />

:::info
It is possible for providers to invalidate themselves by using `ref.invalidateSelf`.
Although in this case, this will always result in a new state being created.
:::

:::tip
When trying to invalidate a provider which receives parameters,
it is posible to either invalidate one specific parameter combination,
or all parameter combinations at once:

<AutoSnippet {...invalidateFamilyExample} />
:::

## Fine-tuned disposal with `ref.keepAlive`

As mentioned above, when automatic disposal is enabled, the state is destroyed
when the provider has no listeners for a full frame.

But you may want to have more control over this behavior. For instance,
you may want to keep the state of successful network requests,
but not cache failed requests.

This can be achieved with `ref.keepAlive`, after enabling automatic disposal.
Using it, you can decide _when_ the state stops being automatically disposed.

<AutoSnippet {...keepAlive} />

:::note
If the provider is recomputed, automatic disposal will be re-enabled.

It is also possible to use the return value of `ref.keepAlive` to
revert to automatic disposal.
:::

## Example: keeping state alive for a specific amount of time

Currently, Riverpod does not offer a built-in way to keep state alive
for a specific amount of time.  
But implementing such a feature is easy and reusable with the tools we've seen so far.

By using a `Timer` + `ref.keepAlive`, we can keep the state alive for a specific amount of time.
To make this logic reusable, we could implement it in an extension method:

<AutoSnippet raw={cacheForExtension} />

Then, we can use it like so:

<AutoSnippet {...cacheForUsage} />

This logic can be tweaked to fit your needs. 
For example, you could use `ref.onCancel`/`ref.onResume` to destroy the state
only if a provider hasn't been listened to for a specific amount of time.
