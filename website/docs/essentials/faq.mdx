Here are some commonly asked questions from the community:

## What is the difference between `ref.refresh` and `ref.invalidate`?

You may have noticed that `ref` has two methods to force a provider to recompute,
and wonder how they differ.

It's simpler than you think: `ref.refresh` is nothing but syntax sugar for
`invalidate` + `read`:

```dart
T refresh<T>(provider) {
  invalidate(provider);
  return read(provider);
}
```

If you do not care about the new value of a provider after recomputing it,
then `invalidate` is the way to go.  
If you do, use `refresh` instead.

:::info
This logic is automatically enforced through lint rules.  
If you tried to use `ref.refresh` without using the returned value,
you would get a warning.
:::

The main difference in behavior is by reading the provider right
after invalidating it, the provider **immediately** recomputes.  
Whereas if we call `invalidate` but don't read it right after,
then the update will trigger _later_.

That "later" update is generally at the start of the next frame.
Yet, if a provider that is currently not being listened to is invalidated, 
it will not be updated until it is listened to again.

## Why is there no shared interface between Ref and WidgetRef?

Riverpod voluntarily dissociates `Ref` and `WidgetRef`.  
This is done on purpose to avoid writing code which conditionally
depends on one or the other.

One issue is that `Ref` and `WidgetRef`, although similar looking,
have subtle differences.  
Code relying on both would be unreliable in ways that are difficult to spot.

At the same time, relying on `WidgetRef` is equivalent to relying on `BuildContext`.
It is effectively putting your logic in the UI layer, which is not recommended.

---

Such code should be refactored to **always** use `Ref`.

The solution to this problem is typically to move your logic
into a `Notifier` (see <Link documentID="essentials/side_effects" />), 
and then have your logic be a method of that `Notifier`.

This way, when your widgets want to invoke this logic, they can
write something along the lines of:

```dart
ref.read(yourNotifierProvider.notifier).yourMethod();
```

`yourMethod` would use the `Notifier`'s `Ref` to interact with other providers.

## Why do we need to extend ConsumerWidget instead of using the raw StatelessWidget?

This is due to an unfortunate limitation in the API of `InheritedWidget`.

There are a few problems:

- It is not possible to implement an "on change" listener with `InheritedWidget`.
  That means that something such as `ref.listen` cannot be used with `BuildContext`.

  `State.didChangeDependencies` is the closest thing to it, but it is not reliable.
  One issue is that the life-cycle can be triggered even if no dependency changed,
  especially if your widget tree uses GlobalKeys (and some Flutter widgets already do so internally).

- Widgets listening to an `InheritedWidget` never stop listening to it.
  This is usually fine for pure metadata, such as "theme" or "media query".

  For business logic, this is a problem.
  Say you use a provider to represent a paginated API.
  When the page offset changes, you wouldn't want your widget to keep listening
  to the previously visible pages.

- `InheritedWidget` has no way to track when widgets stop listening to them.
  Riverpod sometimes relies on tracking whether or not a provider is being listened to.

This functionality is crucial for both the auto dispose mechanism and the ability to
pass arguments to providers.  
Those features are what make Riverpod so powerful.

Maybe in a distant future, those issues will be fixed. In that case,
Riverpod would migrate to using `BuildContext` instead of `Ref`.
This would enable using `StatelessWidget` instead of `ConsumerWidget`.  
But that's for another time!

## Why doesn't hooks_riverpod exports flutter_hooks?

This is to respect good versioning practices.

While you cannot use `hooks_riverpod` without `flutter_hooks`,
both packages are versioned independently. A breaking change could happen
in one but not the other.

## Is there a way to reset all providers at once?

No, there is no way to reset all providers at once.

This is on purpose, as it is considered an anti-pattern. Resetting all providers
at once will often reset providers that you did not intend to reset.

This is commonly asked by users who want to reset the state of their application
when the user logs out.  
If this is what you are after, you should instead have everything dependent on the
user's state to `ref.watch` the "user" provider.

Then, when the user logs out, all providers depending on it would automatically
be reset but everything else would remain untouched.

## I have the error "Cannot use "ref" after the widget was disposed", what's wrong?

You might also see "Bad state: No ProviderScope found", which is an older
error message of the same issue.

This error happens when you try to use `ref` in a widget that is no longer
mounted. This generally happens after an `await`:

```dart
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () async {
    await future;
    ref.read(...); // May throw "Cannot use "ref" after the widget was disposed"
  }
)
```

The solution is to, like with `BuildContext`, check `mounted` before using `ref`:

```dart
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () async {
    await future;
    if (!context.mounted) return;
    ref.read(...); // No longer throws
  }
)
```
