To ensure good maintainability of your code, here is a list of good practices
you should follow when using Riverpod.

This list is not exhaustive, and is subject to change.  
If you have any suggestions, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/rrousselGit/riverpod/issues/new?assignees=rrousselGit&labels=documentation%2C+needs+triage&projects=&template=example_request.md&title=).

Items in this list are not in any particular order.

A good portion of these recommendations can be enforced with [riverpod_lint](https://pub.dev/packages/riverpod_lint).
See <Link documentID="introduction/getting_started" hash="enabling-riverpod_lintcustom_lint"/>
for installation instructions.

## AVOID initializing providers in a widget

Providers should initialize themselves.  
They should not be initialized by an external element such as a widget.

Failing to do so could cause possible race conditions and unexpected behaviors.

**DON'T**

```dart
class WidgetState extends State<MyWidget> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Bad: the provider should initialize itself
    ref.read(provider).init();
  }
}
```

**CONSIDER**

There is no "one-size fits all" solution to this problem.  
If your initialization logic depends on factors external to the provider,
often the correct place to put such logic is in the `onPressed` method of a button
triggering navigation:

```dart
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () {
    ref.read(provider).init();
    Navigator.of(context).push(...);
  },
  child: Text('Navigate'),
)
```

## AVOID using providers for local widget state.

Providers are designed to be for shared business state.
They are not meant to be used for local widget state, such as for:

- storing form state
- currently selected item
- animations
- generally everything that Flutter deals with a "controller" (e.g. `TextEditingController`)

If you are looking for a way to handle local widget state, consider using
[flutter_hooks](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_hooks) instead.

One reason why this is discouraged is that such state is often scoped to a route.  
Failing to do so could break your app's back button, due to a new page overriding
the state of a previous page.

## DON'T perform side effects during the initialization of a provider

Providers should generally be used to represent a "read" operation.
You should not use them for "write" operations, such as submitting a form.

Using providers for such operations could have unexpected behaviors, such as
skipping a side-effect if a previous one was performed.

If you are looking at a way to handle loading/error states of a side-effect,
see <Link documentID="essentials/side_effects"/>.

**DON'T**:

```dart
final submitProvider = FutureProvider((ref) async {
  final formState = ref.watch(formState);

  // Bad: Providers should not be used for "write" operations.
  return http.post('https://my-api.com', body: formState.toJson());
});
```

## PREFER ref.watch/read/listen (and similar APIs) with statically known providers

Riverpod strongly recommends enabling lint rules (via `riverpod_lint`).  
But for lints to be effective, your code should be written in a way that is
statically analysable.

Failing to do so could make it harder to spot bugs or cause
false positives with lints.

**Do**:

```dart
final provider = Provider((ref) => 42);

...

// OK because the provider is known statically
ref.watch(provider);
```

**Don't**:

```dart
class Example extends ConsumerWidget {
  Example({required this.provider});
  final Provider<int> provider;

  @override
  Widget build(context, ref) {
    // Bad because static analysis cannot know what `provider` is
    ref.watch(provider);
  }
}
```

## AVOID dynamically creating providers

Providers should exclusively be top-level final variables.

**Do**:

```dart
final provider = Provider<String>((ref) => 'Hello world');
```

**Don't**:

```dart
class Example {
  // Unsupported operation. Could cause memory leaks and unexpected behaviors.
  final provider = Provider<String>((ref) => 'Hello world');
}
```

:::info
Creating providers as static final variables is allowed,
but not supported by the code-generator.
