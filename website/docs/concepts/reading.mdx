Before reading this guide, make sure to [read about Providers](/docs/concepts/providers) first.

In this guide, we will see how to consume a provider.

## Obtaining a "ref" object

First and foremost, before reading a provider, we need to obtain a "ref" object.

This object is what allows us to interact with providers, be it from a widget
or another provider.

### Obtaining a "ref" from a provider

All providers receive a "ref" as parameter:

```dart
final provider = Provider((ref) {
  // use ref to obtain other providers
  final repository = ref.watch(repositoryProvider);

  return SomeValue(repository);
})
```

This parameter is safe to pass to the value exposed by the provider.

For example, a common use-case is to pass the provider's "ref" to a [StateNotifier]:

<CodeBlock>{trimSnippet(counter)}</CodeBlock>

Doing so would allow our `Counter` class to read providers.

### Obtaining a "ref" from a widget

Widgets naturally do not have a ref parameter. But [Riverpod] offers multiple
solutions to obtain one from widgets.

#### Extending ConsumerWidget instead of StatelessWidget

The most common solution will be to replace [StatelessWidget] by [ConsumerWidget]
when creating a widget.

[ConsumerWidget] is basically identical to [StatelessWidget], with the only
difference being that it has an extra parameter on its build method: the "ref" object.

A typical [ConsumerWidget] would look like:

<CodeBlock>{trimSnippet(consumerWidget)}</CodeBlock>

#### Extending ConsumerStatefulWidget+ConsumerState instead of StatefulWidget+State

Similar to [ConsumerWidget], [ConsumerStatefulWidget] and [ConsumerState] are the equivalent of a
[StatefulWidget] with its [State], with the difference that the state has a "ref" object.

This time, the "ref" isn't passed as parameter of the build method, but is rather
a property of the [ConsumerState] object:

<CodeBlock>{trimSnippet(consumerStatefulWidget)}</CodeBlock>

#### Extending HookConsumerWidget instead of HookWidget

This solution is specific to [flutter_hooks] users. Since [flutter_hooks] requires
extending [HookWidget] to work, widgets that use hooks are unable to extend
[ConsumerWidget].

One solution is, through the package [hooks_riverpod], replace [HookWidget]
by [HookConsumerWidget].  
[HookConsumerWidget] acts as both a [ConsumerWidget] and a [HookWidget]. This
allows a widget to both listen to providers and use hooks.

An example would be:

<CodeBlock>{trimSnippet(consumerHookWidget)}</CodeBlock>

#### Consumer and HookConsumer widgets

A final solution for obtaining a "ref" inside widgets is to rely on [Consumer]/
[HookConsumer].

These classes are widgets that can be used to obtain a "ref", with the same
properties as [ConsumerWidget]/[HookConsumerWidget].

These widgets can be a way to obtain a "ref" without having to define a class.
An example would be:

<CodeBlock>{trimSnippet(consumerHook)}</CodeBlock>

## Using ref to interact with providers

Now that we have a "ref", we can start using it.

There are three primary usages for "ref":

- obtaining the value of a provider and listening to changes, such that when
  this value changes, this will rebuild the widget or provider that subscribed
  to the value.
  That can be done using `ref.watch`
- adding a listener on a provider, to execute an action whenever
  that provider changes.  
  That can be done using `ref.listen`.
- obtaining the value of a provider while ignoring changes.
  This is useful when we need the value of a provider in an event
  such as "on click".
  That can be done using `ref.read`.

:::note
Whenever possible, prefer using `ref.watch` over `ref.read` or `ref.listen` to
implement a feature.  
By changing your implementation to rely on `ref.watch`, it becomes both reactive
and declarative, which makes your application more maintainable.
:::

### Using ref.watch to observe a provider

It is possible to use `ref.watch` inside the `build` method of a widget or
inside the body of a provider to have the widget/provider listen to provider:

For example, a provider could use `ref.watch` to combine multiple providers
into a new value.

An example would be filtering a todo-list.
We could have two providers:

- `filterTypeProvider`, a provider that exposes the current type of filter
  (none, show only completed tasks, ...)
- `todosProvider`, a provider that exposes the entire list of tasks

With this, using `ref.watch`, we could make a third provider that combines both providers to
create a filtered list of tasks:

<CodeBlock>{trimSnippet(watch)}</CodeBlock>

With this code, `filteredTodoListProvider` now exposes the filtered list of tasks.

The filtered list will also automatically update if the filter or the list of tasks
changed. Yet at the same time, the filtered list will not be recomputed if
neither the filter nor the list of tasks changed.

Similarly, a widget could use `ref.watch` to show a user interface that depends
on a provider:

<CodeBlock>{trimSnippet(watchBuild)}</CodeBlock>

This snippet shows a widgets that listens to a provider which stores a counter.
And if that counter changes, the widget will rebuild and the UI will update
to show the new value.

:::caution
The `watch` method should not be called asynchronously,
like inside `onPressed` or a [ElevatedButton]. Nor should it be used
inside `initState` and other [State] life-cycles.

In those cases, consider using `ref.read` instead.
:::

### Using ref.listen to react to a provider change

Similarly to `ref.watch`, it is possible to use `ref.listen` to observe a provider.

The main difference between them is that, rather than rebuilding the widget/provider
if the listened provider changes, using `ref.listen` will instead call a custom function.

That can be useful to perform actions when a certain change happens, such that
to show a snackbar when an error happens.

The `ref.listen` method needs 2 positional arguments, the first one is the Provider and the second one is the callback function that we want to execute when the state change.
The callback function when called will return 2 values, the value of the previous State and the value of the new State. 

The `ref.listen` method can be used inside the body of a provider:

<CodeBlock>{trimSnippet(listen)}</CodeBlock>

or inside the `build` method of a widget:

<CodeBlock>{trimSnippet(listenBuild)}</CodeBlock>

:::caution
The `listen` method should not be called asynchronously,
like inside `onPressed` or an [ElevatedButton]. Nor should it be used
inside `initState` and other [State] life-cycles.
:::

### Using ref.read to obtain the state of a provider once

The `ref.read` method is a way to obtain the state of a provider, without any
extra effect.

It is commonly used inside functions triggered on user interactions.
For example, we can use `ref.read` to increment a counter when a user click on a button:

<CodeBlock>{trimSnippet(read)}</CodeBlock>

:::note
Using `ref.read` should be avoided as much as possible.

It exists as a work-around for cases where using `watch` or `listen` would
be otherwise too inconvenient to use.  
If you can, it is almost always better to use `watch`/`listen`, especially `watch`.
:::

#### **DON'T** use `ref.read` inside the build method

You might be tempted to use `ref.read` to optimize the performance of a widget
by doing:

<CodeBlock>{trimSnippet(readBuild)}</CodeBlock>

But this is a very bad practice and can cause bugs that are difficult to track.

Using `ref.read` this way is commonly associated with the thought "The value
exposed by a provider never changes so using 'ref.read' is safe".  
The problem with this assumption is that, while today that provider
may indeed never update its value, there is no guarantee that tomorrow will be
the same.

Software tends to change a lot, and it is likely that in the future, a value
that previously never changed will need to change.  
But if you used `ref.read`, when that value starts to change, you would have
to go through your entire codebase to change `ref.read` into `ref.watch` –
which is error prone and chances are you'll forget some cases.

Whereas if you used `ref.watch` to begin with, you wouldn't have any problem

**_But I wanted to use `ref.read` to reduce the number of times my widget rebuilds_**

While the goal is commendable, it is important to note that you can achieve the
exact same effect (reducing the number of builds) using `ref.watch` instead.

Providers offer various ways to obtain a value while reducing the number of
rebuilds, which you could use instead.

For example instead of

<CodeBlock>{trimSnippet(readNotifierBuild)}</CodeBlock>

we could do:

<CodeBlock>{trimSnippet(watchNotifierBuild)}</CodeBlock>

Both snippets achieve the same effect: our button will not rebuild when the
counter increments.

On the other hand, the second approach supports cases where the counter is reset.  
For example, another part of the application could call:

```dart
ref.refresh(counterProvider);
```

which would recreate the `StateController` object.

If we used `ref.read` here, our button would still use the previous
`StateController` instance, which was disposed and should no-longer be used.  
Whereas using `ref.watch` correctly rebuilt the button to use the new `StateController`.

## Deciding what to read

Depending on the provider you want to listen, you may have multiple possible
values that you can listen.

As example, consider the following [StreamProvider]:

```dart
final userProvider = StreamProvider<User>(...);
```

When reading this `userProvider`, you can:

- synchronously read the current state by listening to `userProvider` itself:

  ```dart
  Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
    AsyncValue<User> user = ref.watch(userProvider);

    return user.when(
      loading: () => const CircularProgressIndicator(),
      error: (error, stack) => const Text('Oops'),
      data: (user) => Text(user.name),
    );
  }
  ```

- obtain the associated [Stream], by listening to `userProvider.stream`:

  ```dart
  Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
    Stream<User> user = ref.watch(userProvider.stream);
  }
  ```

- obtain a [Future] that resolves with the latest value emitted, by listening to `userProvider.future`:

  ```dart
  Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
    Future<User> user = ref.watch(userProvider.future);
  }
  ```

Other providers may offer different alternative values.  
For more information, refer to the documentation of each provider by
consulting the [API reference](https://pub.dev/documentation/riverpod/latest/riverpod/riverpod-library.html).

## Using "select" to filter rebuilds

One final feature to mention related to reading providers is the ability to
reduce the number of times a widget/provider rebuilds, or how often `ref.listen`
executes a function.

This is important to keep in mind as, by default, listening to a provider
listens to the entire object. But in some cases, a widget/provider may only
care about some properties instead of the whole object.

For example, a provider may expose a `User`:

```dart
abstract class User {
  String get name;
  int get age;
}
```

But a widget may only use the user name:

```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
  User user = ref.watch(userProvider);
  return Text(user.name);
}
```

If we naively used `ref.watch`, this would rebuild the widget when the user's
`age` changes.

The solution is to use `select` to explicitly tell Riverpod that we only
want to listen to some properties of the `User`.

The updated code would be:

```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
  String name = ref.watch(userProvider.select((user) => user.name));
  return Text(name);
}
```

The way this works is, by using `select`, we are specifying a function
that returns the property that we care about.

Then, whenever the `User` changes, Riverpod will call this function and
compare the previous and new result. If they are different (such as when the name
changed), Riverpod will rebuild the widget.  
But if they are equal (such as when the age changed), then Riverpod will not
rebuild the widget.

:::info
It is possible to use `select` with `ref.listen` too:

```dart
ref.listen<String>(
  userProvider.select((user) => user.name),
  (String? previousName, String newName) {
    print('The user name changed $newName');
  }
);
```

Doing so will call the listener only when the name changes.
:::

:::tip
You don't have to return a property of the object. Any value that
overrides == will work. For example you could do:

```dart
final label = ref.watch(userProvider.select((user) => 'Mr ${user.name}'));
```
