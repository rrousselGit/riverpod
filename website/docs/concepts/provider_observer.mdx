[ProviderObserver] listens to the changes of a ProviderContainer.

To use it, extend the class ProviderObserver and override the method you like to use.

[ProviderObserver] has three methods :

- `didAddProvider` is called every time a provider was initialized, and the value exposed is value.
- `didDisposeProvider` is called every time A provider was disposed
- `didUpdateProvider` is called every time my providers when they emit a notification.

### Usage :

A simple use case for [ProviderObserver], is to log the changes in providers by overriding the method `didUpdateProvider`.

<CodeBlock>{trimSnippet(logger)}</CodeBlock>

Now that every time the value of our provider is updated, the logger will log it :

```
I/flutter (16783): {
I/flutter (16783):   "provider": "counter",
I/flutter (16783):   "newValue": "1"
I/flutter (16783): }
```
