title: Combining providers

Make sure to [read about Providers](/docs/concepts/providers) first.  
In this guide, we will see everything there is to know about combining providers.

## Combining providers

We've previously seen how to create a simple provider. But the reality is,
in many situation a provider will want to read the state of another provider.

To do that, we can use the [ref] object passed to the callback of our provider,
and use its [watch] method.

As an example, consider the following provider:

```dart
final cityProvider = Provider((ref) => 'London');
```

We can now create another provider that will consume our `cityProvider`:

```dart
final weatherProvider = FutureProvider((ref) async {
  // We use `ref.watch` to listen to another provider, and we pass it the provider
  // that we want to consume. Here: cityProvider
  final city = ref.watch(cityProvider);

  // We can then use the result to do something based on the value of `cityProvider`.
  return fetchWeather(city: city);
});
```

That's it. We've created a provider that depends on another provider.

## FAQ

### What if the value listened changes over time?

Depending on the provider that you are listening, the value obtained may change
over time.  
For example, you may be listening to a [StateNotifierProvider], or the provider
listened was forced to refresh using [ProviderContainer.refresh]/[context.refresh].

When using [watch], Riverpod is able to detect that the value listened changed
and will _automatically_ re-execute the provider when needed.

This can be useful for computed states.
For example, consider a [StateNotifierProvider] that exposes a todo-list:

```dart
class TodoList extends StateNotifier<List<Todo>> {
  TodoList(): super(const []);
}

final todoListProvider = StateNotifierProvider((ref) => TodoList());
```

A common use-case would be to have the UI filter the list of todos to show
only the completed/uncompleted todos.

An easy way to implement such scenario would be to:

- create [StateProvider], which exposes the currently selected filter method:

  ```dart
  enum Filter {
    none,
    completed,
    uncompleted,
  }

  final filterProvider = StateProvider((ref) => Filter.none);
  ```

- make a separate provider which combines the filter method and the todo-list
  to expose the filtered todo-list:

  ```dart
  final filteredTodoListProvider = Provider<List<Todo>>((ref) {
    final filter = ref.watch(filterProvider);
    final todos = ref.watch(todoListProvider);

    switch (filter.state) {
      case Filter.none:
        return todos;
      case Filter.completed:
        return todos.where((todo) => todo.completed).toList();
      case Filter.uncompleted:
        return todos.where((todo) => !todo.completed).toList();
    }
  });
  ```

Then, our UI can listen to `filteredTodoListProvider` to listen to the filtered todo-list.  
Using such approach, the UI will automatically update when either the filter
or the todo-list changes.

To see this approach in action, you can look at the source code of the [Todo List
example](https://github.com/rrousselGit/river_pod/tree/master/examples/todos)

:::info
This behavior is not specific to [Provider], and works with all providers.

For example, you could combine [watch] with [FutureProvider] to implement a search
feature or live-configurations change:

```dart
// The current search filter
final searchProvider = StateProvider((ref) => '');

/// Configurations which can change over time
final configsProvider = StreamProvider<Configuration>(...);

final charactersProvider = FutureProvider<List<Character>>((ref) async {
  final search = ref.watch(searchProvider);
  final configs = await ref.watch(configsProvider.last);
  final response = await dio.get('${configs.host}/characters?search=$search');

  return response.data.map((json) => Character.fromJson(json)).toList();
});
```

This code will fetch a list of characters from the service, and automatically
re-fetch the list whenever the configurations changes or when the search query changes.

### Can I read a provider without listening to it?

Sometimes, we want to read the content of a provider, but without re-creating
the value exposed when the value obtained changes.

An example would be a `Repository`, which reads from another provider the user token
for authentification.  
We could use [watch] and create a new `Repository` whenever the user token changes,
but there is little to no use in doing that.

In this situation, we can use [read], which is similar to [watch], but will not
cause the provider to recreate its value exposed when the value obtained changes.

In that case, a common practice is to pass `ref.read` to the object created.
The object created will then be able to read providers whenever it wants.

```dart
final userTokenProvider = StateProvider<String>((ref) => null);

final repositoryProvider = Provider((ref) => Repository(ref.read));

class Repository {
  Repository(this.read);

  /// The `ref.read` function
  final Reader read;

  Future<Catalog> fetchCatalog() async {
    String token = read(userTokenProvider).state;

    final response = await dio.get('/path', queryParameters: {
      'token': token,
    });

    return Catalog.fromJson(response.data);
  }
}
```

:::note
You could also pass the `ref` instead of `ref.read` to your object:

```dart
final repositoryProvider = Provider((ref) => Repository(ref));

class Repository {
  Repository(this.ref);

  final ProviderRefBase ref;
}
```

The only difference that passing `ref.read` brings is a slightly less verbose
code and making sure that our object never uses `ref.watch`.
:::

:::danger **DON'T** call [read] inside the body of a provider

```dart
final myProvider = Provider((ref) {
  // Bad practice to call `read` here
  final value = ref.read(anotherProvider);
});
```

If you used [read] as an attempt to avoid unwanted rebuilds of your object,
refer to [My provider updates too often, what can I do?](#my-provider-updates-too-often-what-can-i-do)

### How to test an object that receives [read] as parameter of its constructor?

If you are using the pattern described in [Can I read a provider without listening to it?](#can-i-read-a-provider-without-listening-to-it),
you may be wondering how to write tests for your object.

In this scenario, consider testing the provider directly instead of the raw object.
You can do so by using the [ProviderContainer] class:

```dart
final repositoryProvider = Provider((ref) => Repository(ref.read));

test('fetches catalog', () async {
  final container = ProviderContainer();
  Repository repository = container.read(repositoryProvider);

  await expectLater(
    repository.fetchCatalog(),
    completion(Catalog()),
  );
});
```

### My provider updates too often, what can I do?

If your object is re-created too often chances are, your provider is listening
to objects that it doesn't care about.

For example, you may be listening a `Configuration` object, but only use the `host`
property.  
By listening to the entire `Configuration` object, if a property other than `host`
changes, this would still cause your provider to be re-evaluated â€“ which may be
undesired.

The solution to this problem is to create a separate provider that exposes _only_
what you need in `Configuration` (so `host`):

**AVOID** listening to the entire object:

```dart
final configsProvider = StreamProvider<Configuration>(...);

final productsProvider = FutureProvider<List<Product>>((ref) async {
  // Will cause productsProvider to re-fetch the products if anything in the
  // configurations changes
  final configs = await ref.watch(configsProvider.last);

  return dio.get('${configs.host}/products');
});
```

**PREFER** listening to only what you use:

```dart
final configsProvider = StreamProvider<Configuration>(...);

/// A provider that exposes only the current host
final _hostProvider = FutureProvider<String>((ref) async {
  final config = await ref.watch(configsProvider.last);
  return config.host;
});

final productsProvider = FutureProvider<List<Product>>((ref) async {
  // Listens only to the host. If something else in the configurations
  // changes, this will not pointlessly re-evaluate our provider.
  final host = await ref.watch(_hostProvider.future);

  return dio.get('$host/products');
});
```
