`ChangeNotifierProvider` (flutter_riverpod/hooks_riverpod only) is a provider that
is used to listen to and expose a [ChangeNotifier] from Flutter itself.

Using `ChangeNotifierProvider` is discouraged by Riverpod and exists primarily for:

- an easy transition from `package:provider` when using its `ChangeNotifierProvider`
- supporting mutable state, even though immutable state is preferred

:::info
Prefer using [NotifierProvider] instead.  
Consider using `ChangeNotifierProvider` only if you are absolutely certain
that you want mutable state.
:::

Using mutable state instead of immutable state can sometimes be more efficient.
The downside is, it can be harder to maintain and may break various features.  
For example, using `provider.select` to optimize rebuilds of your widgets
may not work if your state is mutable, as `select` will think that the value
hasn't changed.  
As such, using immutable data structures can sometimes be faster. Therefore
it is important to make benchmarks specific to your use-case, to make sure
that you are truly gaining performance by using `ChangeNotifierProvider`.

As a usage example, we could use `ChangeNotifierProvider` to implement a todo-list.
Doing so would allow us to expose methods such as `addTodo` to let the UI
modify the list of todos on user interactions:

<CodeBlock>{trimSnippet(todos)}</CodeBlock>

Now that we have defined a `ChangeNotifierProvider`, we can use it to interact
with the list of todos in our UI:

<CodeBlock>{trimSnippet(todosConsumer)}</CodeBlock>
