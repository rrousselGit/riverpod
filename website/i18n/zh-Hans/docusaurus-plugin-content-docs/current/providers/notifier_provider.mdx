[NotifierProvider] is a provider that is used to listen to and expose a [Notifier].  
[AsyncNotifierProvider] is a provider that is used to listen to and expose an [AsyncNotifier].
[AsyncNotifier] is a [Notifier] that can be asynchronously initialized.  
`(Async)NotifierProvider` along with `(Async)Notifier` is Riverpod's recommended solution
for managing state which may change in reaction to a user interaction.

It is typically used for:

- exposing a state which can change over time after reacting to custom events.
- centralizing the logic for modifying some state (aka "business logic") in a
  single place, improving maintainability over time.

As a usage example, we could use [NotifierProvider] to implement a todo-list.
Doing so would allow us to expose methods such as `addTodo` to let the UI
modify the list of todos on user interactions:

<AutoSnippet language="dart" {...todos}></AutoSnippet>

Now that we have defined a [NotifierProvider], we can use it to interact
with the list of todos in our UI:

<CodeBlock>{trimSnippet(todosConsumer)}</CodeBlock>

As a usage example, we could use [AsyncNotifierProvider] to implement a remote todo-list.
Doing so would allow us to expose methods such as `addTodo` to let the UI
modify the list of todos on user interactions:

<AutoSnippet language="dart" {...remoteTodos}></AutoSnippet>

Now that we have defined a [AsyncNotifierProvider], we can use it to interact
with the list of todos in our UI:

<CodeBlock>{trimSnippet(remoteTodosConsumer)}</CodeBlock>
