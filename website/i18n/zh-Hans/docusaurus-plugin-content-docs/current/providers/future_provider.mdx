`FutureProvider` is the equivalent of [Provider] but for asynchronous code.

`FutureProvider` is typically used for:

- performing and caching asynchronous operations (such as network requests)
- nicely handling error/loading states of asynchronous operations
- combining multiple asynchronous values into another value

`FutureProvider` gains a lot when combined with [ref.watch]. This combination
allows automatic re-fetching of some data when some variables change,
ensuring that we always have the most up-to-date value.

:::info
`FutureProvider` does not offer a way of directly modifying the computation after
a user interaction. It is designed to solve simple use-cases.  
For more advanced scenarios, consider using [AsyncNotifierProvider].
:::

## Usage example: reading a configuration file

`FutureProvider` can be a convenient way to expose a `Configuration` object
created by reading a JSON file.

Creating the configuration would be done with your typical async/await
syntax, but inside the provider.
Using Flutter's asset system, this would be:

<AutoSnippet language="dart" {...configProvider}></AutoSnippet>


Then, the UI can listen to configurations like so:

<AutoSnippet language="dart" {...configConsumer}></AutoSnippet>

This will automatically rebuild the UI when the [Future] completes.
At the same time, if multiple widgets want the configurations,
the asset will be decoded only once.

As you can see, listening to a `FutureProvider` inside a widget returns
an [AsyncValue] – which allows handling the error/loading states.
