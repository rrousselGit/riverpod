[ProviderObserver] listens to the changes of a ProviderContainer.

To use it, extend the class ProviderObserver and override the method you want to use.

[ProviderObserver] has three methods :

- `didAddProvider` is called every time a provider was initialized, and the value exposed is `value`.
- `didDisposeProvider` is called every time a provider was disposed.
- `didUpdateProvider` is called every time by providers when they emit a notification.

### Usage :

A simple use case for [ProviderObserver] is to log the changes in providers by overriding the `didUpdateProvider` method.

<CodeBlock>{trimSnippet(logger)}</CodeBlock>

Now, every time the value of our provider is updated, the logger will log it:

```
I/flutter (16783): {
I/flutter (16783):   "provider": "counter",
I/flutter (16783):   "newValue": "1"
I/flutter (16783): }
```

:::note:
For states that are mutable such as [StateController] (the state of [StateProvider.state]) and
[ChangeNotifier] the previousValue and newValue will be the same
:::
since they reference the same `StateController` / `ChangeNotifier`.
