This page explains what are hooks and how they are related to Riverpod.

"Hooks" are utilities common from a separate package, independent from Riverpod:
[flutter_hooks].  
Although [flutter_hooks] is a completely separate package and does not have anything
to do with Riverpod (at least directly), it is common to pair Riverpod
and [flutter_hooks] together. After-all, Riverpod and [flutter_hooks] are
maintained by the same team.

Hooks are completely optional. You do not have to use hooks, especially if you
are starting Flutter. They are powerful tools, but not very "Flutter-like".  
As such, it may make sense to start first with plain Flutter/Riverpod, and come back
to hooks once you have a bit more experience.

## What are hooks?

Hooks are functions used inside widgets. They are designed as an alternative
to [StatefulWidget]s, to make logic more reusable and composable.

Hooks are a concept coming from [React](https://reactjs.org/), and [flutter_hooks]
is merely a port of the React implementation to Flutter.  
As such, yes, hooks may feel a bit out of place in Flutter. Ideally,
in the future we would have a solution to the problem that hooks solves,
designed specifically for Flutter.

If Riverpod's providers are for "global" application state, hooks are for
local widget state. Hooks are typically used for dealing with stateful UI objects,
such as [TextEditingController](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/TextEditingController-class.html),
[AnimationController](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/animation/AnimationController-class.html).  
They can also serve as a replacement to the "builder" pattern, replacing widgets
such as [FutureBuilder](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/FutureBuilder-class.html)/[TweenAnimatedBuilder](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/TweenAnimationBuilder-class.html)
by an alterative that does not invole "nesting" – drastically improving readability.

In general, hooks are helpful for:

- forms
- animations
- reacting to user events
- ...

As an example, we could use hooks to manually implement a fade-in animation,
where a widget starts invisible and slowly appears.

If we were to use [StatefulWidget], the code would look like this:

```dart
class FadeIn extends StatefulWidget {
  const FadeIn({Key? key, required this.child}) : super(key: key);

  final Widget child;

  @override
  State<FadeIn> createState() => _FadeInState();
}

class _FadeInState extends State<FadeIn> with SingleTickerProviderStateMixin {
  late final AnimationController animationController = AnimationController(
    vsync: this,
    duration: const Duration(seconds: 2),
  );

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    animationController.forward();
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    animationController.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return AnimatedBuilder(
      animation: animationController,
      builder: (context, child) {
        return Opacity(
          opacity: animationController.value,
          child: widget.child,
        );
      },
    );
  }
}
```

Using hooks, the equivalent would be:

```dart
class FadeIn extends HookWidget {
  const FadeIn({Key? key, required this.child}) : super(key: key);

  final Widget child;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create an AnimationController. The controller will automatically be
    // disposed when the widget is unmounted.
    final animationController = useAnimationController(
      duration: const Duration(seconds: 2),
    );

    // useEffect is the equivalent of initState + didUpdateWidget + dispose.
    // The callback passed to useEffect is executed the first time the hook is
    // invoked, and then whenever the list passed as second parameter changes.
    // Since we pass an empty const list here, that's strictly equivalent to `initState`.
    useEffect(() {
      // start the animation when the widget is first rendered.
      animationController.forward();
      // We could optionally return some "dispose" logic here
      return null;
    }, const []);

    // Tell Flutter to rebuild this widget when the animation updates.
    // This is equivalent to AnimatedBuilder
    useAnimation(animationController);

    return Opacity(
      opacity: animationController.value,
      child: child,
    );
  }
}
```

There are a few interesting things to note in this code:

- There is no memory leak. This code does not recreate a new `AnimationController` whenever the
  widget rebuild, and the controller is correctly released when the widget is unmounted.

- It is possible to use hooks as many time as we want within the same widget.
  As such, we can create multiple `AnimationController` if we want:

  ```dart
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final animationController = useAnimationController(
      duration: const Duration(seconds: 2),
    );
    final anotherController = useAnimationController(
      duration: const Duration(seconds: 2),
    );

    ...
  }
  ```

  This creates two controllers, without any sort of negative consequence.

- If we wanted, we could refactor this logic into a separate reusable function:

  ```dart
  double useFadeIn() {
    final animationController = useAnimationController(
      duration: const Duration(seconds: 2),
    );
    useEffect(() {
      animationController.forward();
      return null;
    }, const []);
    useAnimation(animationController);
    return animationController.value;
  }
  ```

  We could then use this function inside our widgets, as long as that widget is a [HookWidget]:

  ```dart
  class FadeIn extends HookWidget {
    const FadeIn({Key? key, required this.child}) : super(key: key);

    final Widget child;

    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      final fade = useFadeIn();

      return Opacity(opacity: fade, child: child);
    }
  }
  ```

  Note how our `useFadeIn` function is completely independent from our
  `FadeIn` widget.  
  If we wanted, we could use that `useFadeIn` function in a completely different
  widget, and it would still work!

## How to use hooks

Hooks comes with unique constraints:

- They can only be used within the `build` method of a widget that extends [HookWidget]:

  **Good**:

  ```dart
  class Example extends HookWidget {
    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      final controller = useAnimationController();
      ...
    }
  }
  ```

  **Bad**:

  ```dart
  // Not a HookWidget
  class Example extends StatelessWidget {
    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      final controller = useAnimationController();
      ...
    }
  }
  ```

  **Bad**:

  ```dart
  class Example extends HookWidget {
    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      return ElevatedButton(
        onPressed: () {
          // Not _actually_ inside the "build" method, but instead inside
          // a user interaction lifecycle (here "on pressed").
          final controller = useAnimationController();
        },
        child: Text('click me'),
      );
    }
  }
  ```

- They cannot be used conditionally or in a loop.

  **Bad**:

  ```dart
  class Example extends HookWidget {
    const Example({required this.condition, super.key});
    final bool condition;
    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      if (condition) {
        // Hooks should not be used inside "if"s/"for"s, ...
        final controller = useAnimationController();
      }
      ...
    }
  }
  ```
