## Unreleased build

- **Breaking** various `package:riverpod` objects are no-longer exported.
  If you wish to use providers by hand, you will have to separately import
  `package:riverpod/riverpod.dart`.
- Added `@mutation` support.
  Mutations are a way to enable your UI to easily listen to the status of side-effects.
  See the documentation of `@mutation` for further information.
- Made `@Riverpod` final
- Added `@Dependencies([...])`, for lint purposes.
  This is similar to `@Riverpod(dependencies: [...])`, but is applied on
  non-provider objects that may use a scoped provider.
- Added support for `@Riverpod(retry: ...)`
