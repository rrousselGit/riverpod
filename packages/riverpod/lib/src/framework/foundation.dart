  ///
  /// The [select] function allows filtering unwanted rebuilds of a Widget
  /// by reading only the properties that we care about.
  ///
  /// For example, consider the following `ChangeNotifier`:
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// class Person extends ChangeNotifier {
  ///   int _age = 0;
  ///   int get age => _age;
  ///   set age(int age) {
  ///     _age = age;
  ///     notifyListeners();
  ///   }
  ///
  ///   String _name = '';
  ///   String get name => _name;
  ///   set name(String name) {
  ///     _name = name;
  ///     notifyListeners();
  ///   }
  /// }
  ///
  /// final personProvider = ChangeNotifierProvider((_) => Person());
  /// ```
  ///
  /// In this class, both `name` and `age` may change, but a widget may need
  /// only `age`.
  ///
  /// If we used `ref.watch(`/`Consumer` as we normally would, this would cause
  /// widgets that only use `age` to still rebuild when `name` changes, which
  /// is inefficient.
  ///
  /// The method [select] can be used to fix this, by explicitly reading only
  /// a specific part of the object.
  ///
  /// A typical usage would be:
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// @override
  /// Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
  ///   final age = ref.watch(personProvider.select((p) => p.age));
  ///   return Text('$age');
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// This will cause our widget to rebuild **only** when `age` changes.
  ///
  ///
  /// **NOTE**: The function passed to [select] can return complex computations
  /// too.
  ///
  /// For example, instead of `age`, we could return a "isAdult" boolean:
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// @override
  /// Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
  ///   final isAdult = ref.watch(personProvider.select((p) => p.age >= 18));
  ///   return Text('$isAdult');
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// This will further optimise our widget by rebuilding it only when "isAdult"
  /// changed instead of whenever the age changes.
