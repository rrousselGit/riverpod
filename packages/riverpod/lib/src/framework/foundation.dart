  ///
  /// The content of [dependencies] should be a list of all the providers that
  /// this provider may depend on which can be scoped.
  ///
  /// For example, consider the following providers:
  /// ```dart
  /// // By not specifying "dependencies", we are saying that this provider is never scoped
  /// final rootProvider = Provider((ref) => Foo());
  /// // By specifying "dependencies" (even if the list is empty),
  /// // we are saying that this provider is potentially scoped
  /// final scopedProvider = Provider((ref) => Foo(), dependencies: []);
  /// ```
  ///
  /// Then if we were to depend on `rootProvider` in a scoped provider, we
  /// could write any of:
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// final dependentProvider = Provider((ref) {
  ///   ref.watch(rootProvider);
  ///   // This provider does not depend on any scoped provider,
  ///   // as such "dependencies" is optional
  /// });
  ///
  /// final dependentProvider = Provider((ref) {
  ///   ref.watch(rootProvider);
  ///   // This provider decided to specify "dependencies" anyway, marking
  ///   // "dependentProvider" as possibly scoped.
  ///   // Since "rootProvider" is never scoped, it doesn't need to be included
  ///   // in "dependencies".
  /// }, dependencies: []);
  ///
  /// final dependentProvider = Provider((ref) {
  ///   ref.watch(rootProvider);
  ///   // Including "rootProvider" in "dependencies" is fine too, even though
  ///   // it is not required. It is a no-op.
  /// }, dependencies: [rootProvider]);
  /// ```
  ///
  /// However, if we were to depend on `scopedProvider` then our only choice is:
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// final dependentProvider = Provider((ref) {
  ///   ref.watch(scopedProvider);
  ///   // Since "scopedProvider" specifies "dependencies", any provider that
  ///   // depends on it must also specify "dependencies" and include "scopedProvider".

  /// ```dart
  /// class Person extends ChangeNotifier {
  ///   int _age = 0;
  ///   int get age => _age;
  ///   set age(int age) {

  /// final personProvider = ChangeNotifierProvider((_) => Person());
  /// ```
  ///
  /// In this class, both `name` and `age` may change, but a widget may need
  /// only `age`.
  ///
  /// If we used `ref.watch(`/`Consumer` as we normally would, this would cause
  /// widgets that only use `age` to still rebuild when `name` changes, which
  /// is inefficient.
  ///
  /// The method [select] can be used to fix this, by explicitly reading only
  /// a specific part of the object.
  ///
  /// A typical usage would be:
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// @override
  /// Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
  ///   final age = ref.watch(personProvider.select((p) => p.age));
  ///   return Text('$age');
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// This will cause our widget to rebuild **only** when `age` changes.
  ///
  ///
  /// **NOTE**: The function passed to [select] can return complex computations
  /// too.
  ///
  /// For example, instead of `age`, we could return a "isAdult" boolean:
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// @override
  /// Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
  ///   final isAdult = ref.watch(personProvider.select((p) => p.age >= 18));
  ///   return Text('$isAdult');
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// This will further optimise our widget by rebuilding it only when "isAdult"
  /// changed instead of whenever the age changes.
