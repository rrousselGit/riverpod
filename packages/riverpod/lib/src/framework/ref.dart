  /// Good:
  /// ```dart
  /// final disposable1 = Disposable(...);

  /// final disposable2 = Disposable(...);
  /// ref.onDispose(disposable2.dispose);

  /// ref.onDispose(() {

  ///   disposable2.dispose();

  /// - It prevents memory leaks in cases of an exception.
  ///   If an exception happens inside a `dispose()` call, or

  /// By calling [read] instead of [watch], this will not cause a provider's

  /// object like so:
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// final configsProvider = FutureProvider(...);
  /// final myServiceProvider = Provider(MyService.new);
  ///
  /// class MyService {
  ///   MyService(this.ref);
  ///
  ///   final Ref ref;
  ///
  ///   Future<User> fetchUser() {
  ///     // We read the current configurations, but do not care about

  ///     final configs = ref.read(configsProvider.future);
  ///
  ///     return dio.get(configs.host);
  ///   }
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// By passing [Ref] to an object, this allows our object to read other providers.
  /// But we do not want to re-create our object if any of the provider
  /// obtained changes. We only want to read their current value without doing
  /// anything else.

  /// If possible, avoid using [read] and prefer [watch], which is generally

  /// The problem is that once the provider gets initialized, logic that
  /// depends on the existence or not of a provider won't be rerun; possibly
  /// causing your state to get out of date.
  ///
  /// But it can be useful in some cases, such as to avoid re-fetching an

  ///
  /// ```dart

  ///
  /// final fetchItem = FutureProvider.autoDispose.family<Item, String>((ref, id) async {

  ///     );

  /// });

  /// Obtains the state of a provider and causes the state to be re-evaluated
  /// when that provider emits a new value.
  ///
  /// Using [watch] allows supporting the scenario where we want to re-create
  /// our state when one of the object we are listening to changed.
  ///
  /// This method should be your go-to way to make a provider read another
  /// provider – even if the value exposed by that other provider never changes.
  ///
  /// ## Use-case example: Sorting a todo-list
  ///
  /// Consider a todo-list application. We may want to implement a sort feature,
  /// to see the uncompleted todos first.\
  /// We will want to create a sorted list of todos based on the
  /// combination of the unsorted list and a sort method (ascendant, descendant, ...),
  /// both of which may change over time.
  ///
  /// In this situation, what we do not want to do is to sort our list
  /// directly inside the `build` method of our UI, as sorting a list can be
  /// expensive.
  /// But maintaining a cache manually is difficult and error prone.
  ///
  /// To solve this problem, we could create a separate [Provider] that will
  /// expose the sorted list, and use [watch] to automatically re-evaluate
  /// the list **only** when needed.
  ///
  /// In code, this may look like:
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// final sortProvider = StateProvider((_) => Sort.byName);
  /// final unsortedTodosProvider = StateProvider((_) => <Todo>[]);
  ///
  /// final sortedTodosProvider = Provider((ref) {
  ///   // listen to both the sort enum and the unfiltered list of todos
  ///   final sort = ref.watch(sortProvider);
  ///   final todos = ref.watch(unsortedTodosProvider);
  ///
  ///   // Creates a new sorted list from the combination of the unfiltered
  ///   // list and the filter type.
  ///   return [...todos].sort((a, b) { ... });
  /// });
  /// ```
  ///
  /// In this code, by using [Provider] + [watch]:
  ///
  /// - if either `sortProvider` or `unsortedTodosProvider` changes, then
  ///   `sortedTodosProvider` will automatically be recomputed.
  /// - if multiple widgets depends on `sortedTodosProvider` the list will be
  ///   sorted only once.
  /// - if nothing is listening to `sortedTodosProvider`, then no sort is performed.
