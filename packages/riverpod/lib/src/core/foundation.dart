  /// Specifying this list is strictly equivalent to saying "This provider may

  /// If it is never scoped, it should not specify [dependencies].
  ///
  /// The content of [dependencies] should be a list of all the providers that
  /// this provider may depend on which can be scoped.
  ///
  /// For example, consider the following providers:
  /// ```dart
  /// // By not specifying "dependencies", we are saying that this provider is never scoped
  /// final rootProvider = Provider((ref) => Foo());
  /// // By specifying "dependencies" (even if the list is empty),
  /// // we are saying that this provider is potentially scoped
  /// final scopedProvider = Provider((ref) => Foo(), dependencies: []);
  /// ```
  ///
  /// Then if we were to depend on `rootProvider` in a scoped provider, we
  /// could write any of:
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// final dependentProvider = Provider((ref) {
  ///   ref.watch(rootProvider);
  ///   // This provider does not depend on any scoped provider,
  ///   // as such "dependencies" is optional
  /// });
  ///
  /// final dependentProvider = Provider((ref) {
  ///   ref.watch(rootProvider);
  ///   // This provider decided to specify "dependencies" anyway, marking
  ///   // "dependentProvider" as possibly scoped.
  ///   // Since "rootProvider" is never scoped, it doesn't need to be included
  ///   // in "dependencies".
  /// }, dependencies: []);
  ///
  /// final dependentProvider = Provider((ref) {
  ///   ref.watch(rootProvider);
  ///   // Including "rootProvider" in "dependencies" is fine too, even though
  ///   // it is not required. It is a no-op.
  /// }, dependencies: [rootProvider]);
  /// ```
  ///
  /// However, if we were to depend on `scopedProvider` then our only choice is:
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// final dependentProvider = Provider((ref) {
  ///   ref.watch(scopedProvider);
  ///   // Since "scopedProvider" specifies "dependencies", any provider that
  ///   // depends on it must also specify "dependencies" and include "scopedProvider".
  /// }, dependencies: [scopedProvider]);
