  /// directly inside the `build` method of our UI, as sorting a list can be
  /// expensive.
  /// But maintaining a cache manually is difficult and error prone.
  ///
  /// To solve this problem, we could create a separate [Provider] that will
  /// expose the sorted list, and use [watch] to automatically re-evaluate
  /// the list **only** when needed.
  ///
  /// In code, this may look like:
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// final sortProvider = StateProvider((_) => Sort.byName);
  /// final unsortedTodosProvider = StateProvider((_) => <Todo>[]);
  ///
  /// final sortedTodosProvider = Provider((ref) {
  ///   // listen to both the sort enum and the unfiltered list of todos
  ///   final sort = ref.watch(sortProvider);
  ///   final todos = ref.watch(unsortedTodosProvider);
  ///
  ///   // Creates a new sorted list from the combination of the unfiltered
  ///   // list and the filter type.
  ///   return [...todos].sort((a, b) { ... });
  /// });
  /// ```
  ///
  /// In this code, by using [Provider] + [watch]:
  ///
  /// - if either `sortProvider` or `unsortedTodosProvider` changes, then
  ///   `sortedTodosProvider` will automatically be recomputed.
  /// - if multiple widgets depends on `sortedTodosProvider` the list will be
  ///   sorted only once.
  /// - if nothing is listening to `sortedTodosProvider`, then no sort is performed.
